However, in most cases a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/neck-lift-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neck lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ends up being an integral part of a complete face lift, especially when it comes to an <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/extended-deep-plane-facelift\/\">extended deep plane facelift<\/a> procedure. The SMAS muscle system is intricately connected between the lower face and the neck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes patients are looking for a more contoured neck or jawline, but aren\u2019t necessarily in the market for a full facelift yet. At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we offer multiple surgical and non-surgical procedures that can solve this issue. We are particularly proud to offer MyEllevate\u00ae as a minimally invasive procedure that provides a great alternative to a traditional neck lift near you in NYC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Am I a candidate for a neck lift?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people don\u2019t pay enough attention to their neck region despite the fact that it often shows some of the earliest and worst signs of aging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, you should consider a neck procedure if you:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are self-conscious about your neck and its appearance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience issues with hanging or sagging skin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have excess fat under your jaw or chin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have deep creases or banding in the front of your neck<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are in good physical and mental health<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For patients who aren\u2019t ready to commit to a full surgical <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/neck-lift-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neck lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> procedure, we do offer minimally invasive and noninvasive options for neck cosmetic treatments as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t neglect your neck!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about it: your neck tends to get the same amount of sun exposure that the face does. Plus, your neck also develops creases from repeated muscle movement and can have loose skin following weight changes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The skin all over your body experiences the same types of changes as your body ages. Your body produces less collagen as you get older causing your skin to lose elasticity and start to sag. This change is particularly noticeable on the face and neck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, we have the added upsides and downsides of technology, key word being <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">down<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. All the time we spend looking down at our phones and taking Zoom calls on our computers can cause the neck to develop lines and platysmal bands, known as \u201ctech neck.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people don\u2019t pay attention to the neck region, but cosmetic work for the neck can make you appear dramatically younger.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the difference between a neck lift and a facelift?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When completing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/neck-lift-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neck lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is usually an integral part of the process as a combined procedure. The reverse is not necessarily true.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every patient who receives a neck lift will need a facelift. The two areas of the body are very connected however, and what type of procedure will be dependent on a patient\u2019s individual goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular Neck Lift Plastic Surgery Procedures<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We offer a variety of different cosmetic procedures for the neck at Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery. It\u2019s our goal to always provide the right procedure for your unique aesthetic goals as the patient. Whether you\u2019re ready to dive in for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/neck-lift-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full neck lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or are looking for an alternative to a neck lift near you in NYC, we\u2019ve got an option for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neck Lift<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, we offer the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/neck-lift-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traditional neck lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This surgery tightens the neck by removing excess skin, fat, and decreasing the appearance of neck bands. Neck lift is also often combined with chin augmentation in younger patients. Frequently excess fat under the chin and a receding chin are found together.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neck Liposuction<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For patients who have a pronounced \u201cdouble chin\u201d or excess fat in the neck area, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/chin-liposuction-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neck liposuction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the ideal procedure. It can even be combined with a neck lift, as the skin is often loose after removing excess fat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N\u00e9collet\u00e9\u2122<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for a nonsurgical neck lift near NYC, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/non-surgical-neck-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N\u00e9collet\u00e9\u2122<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is Dr. Pearlman\u2019s exclusive, highly customizable procedure. It uses a variety of techniques to help revitalize the neck and decollete area by treating sun damage, wrinkles, and pigmentation issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Related: Neck Plastic Surgery Alternatives<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MyEllevate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new, innovative neck lifting procedure, <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/mini-neck-lift-in-nyc\/\">MyEllevate<\/a> uses suture suspension to lift the neck into a more streamlined silhouette. It\u2019s been called the \u201cZoom Lift\u201d because it specifically targets the neck bands and skin laxity you see when you\u2019re looking down on a video call.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MyEllevate is an alternative to a neck lift near you in NYC<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Dr. Pearlman was one of the first facial plastic surgeons in NYC to learn the MyEllevate procedure and has been performing it since January 2022.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are many benefits to the MyEllevate technique.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimally invasive<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/mini-neck-lift-in-nyc\/\">MyEllevate<\/a> is a step up from noninvasive procedures like N\u00e9collet\u00e9\u2122, but doesn\u2019t require the same level of commitment as a full neck lift. The neck is lifted using suture suspension and is completed using only a few small incisions under local anesthesia.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quicker procedure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A neck lift usually takes about 2 hours to complete, with MyEllevate patients can expect to be done in about 60 minutes. That\u2019s half the time!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less downtime<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to a traditional neck lift procedure, MyElleveate requires less downtime. Most patients are back to normal activities in 3 to 5 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Lasting results<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do you get to enjoy your results sooner because of the shorter downtime, patients are seeing results from MyEllevate\u00ae last as long as 3 years!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combination treatments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most cosmetic procedures, <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/mini-neck-lift-in-nyc\/\">MyEllevate<\/a> can be combined with other treatments and procedures to provide optimal results. It pairs especially well with FaceTite for improving the jawline and jowls and neck liposuction for patients with full necks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is MyEllevate the same as a thread lift?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While MyEllevate does use sutures to lift the muscles and skin, it is not the same as receiving PDO threads. <\/span><b>The sutures used for MyEllevate will last indefinitely, whereas PDO threads dissolve on their own after about 6 to 8 months.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the process for getting a neck lift near me in NYC (or a similar procedure)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our goal at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to establish complete understanding between patient and surgeon or aesthetic provider.
