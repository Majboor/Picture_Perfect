You don\u2019t want to base a life-changing decision on views and likes. This is particularly true when it comes to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-rhinoplasty-surgeon-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is an intricate surgery with very impactful results. That\u2019s why you only want to put your nose in the hands of a top surgeon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rhinoplasty is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures in the United States. With this in mind, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Steven Pearlman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sat down to answer some of the most common questions from patients considering rhinoplasty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman has performed thousands of rhinoplasties and is uniquely dual-board certified in both Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ENT). As one of the top rhinoplasty surgeons in NYC, he has essential expertise for those interested in pursuing a rhinoplasty procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q: Let\u2019s start with the basics, what are the most important qualities of a top rhinoplasty surgeon?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several key things to take note of when you\u2019re considering a surgeon. We always tell patients, <\/span><b>this is going to be the nose you have for the rest of your life<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so it\u2019s important that you\u2019re happy with the results and have a good experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best compliment we get following rhinoplasty is when patients are told they \u201clook great\u201d but their friends and acquaintances can\u2019t tell why. I always strive for the most natural-looking results possible. Our goal is to address your concerns without ever losing sight of who you are, your heritage, and your identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-4\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing to consider: is this surgeon a rhinoplasty specialist?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-rhinoplasty-surgeon-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an extremely delicate surgery. The nose is one of your sensory organs, so you want someone who can protect the function as they\u2019re enhancing the form.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a surgeon who is only board certified in cosmetic surgery isn\u2019t going to have the same level of expertise as someone who is also certified in Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You should look at their level of expertise and what percentage of their practice is dedicated to rhinoplasty.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Is it the primary surgery they provide or is it one of many? How many rhinoplasties have they done? Do they operate all over the body, or specialize in the face? Go to the surgeon\u2019s website and look at their before and afters. Is this the aesthetic you are looking to achieve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, people often found surgeons based on their academic involvement. In order to be giving lectures, teaching residents, and getting papers published, a surgeon has to have a true mastery of rhinoplasty. <\/span><b>More people should consider the academic standing of their surgeons.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next thing to consider: What types of rhinoplasty procedures do they offer?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no one-size-fits-all approach to rhinoplasties. The nose is such a prominent facial feature and for many races and ethnicities has important ties to heritage and culture. As I mentioned earlier, the nose is also a sensory organ. The function is just as important, if not more important, than the form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the procedures and techniques a skilled rhinoplasty surgeon will offer may include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/ultrasonic-rhinoplasty-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piezo ultrasonic rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/ethnic-nose-job-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethnic rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/teenage-rhinoplasty-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teenage rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/revision-rhinoplasty-in-new-york\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revision rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/septoplasty-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Septoplasty<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The top rhinoplasty surgeons in our field are able to incorporate multiple techniques into their practice. Rhinoplasty truly should be a customized experience based on the individual patient\u2019s concerns and anatomy and NEVER a one-size-fits-all approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q: How important are before and after images when choosing a rhinoplasty surgeon?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/before-and-after\/?_sft_ll_bag_name=rhinoplasty\"><b>Rhinoplasty before and after<\/b><\/a><b> photos are absolutely crucial.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A surgeon\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/before-and-after\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before and after gallery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a testament to the level of professionalism and the quality of their work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things you should consider when viewing the images:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do these patients look like me?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do I like the results I\u2019m seeing? Do they look natural?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are the before and after images consistent in setup, lighting, and angles?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>It is a major red flag if the images look doctored or if your surgeon won\u2019t let you see any during your consultation.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should always ask to see images of previous patients during your consultation. It will also give you the opportunity to ask questions about the process for particular cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3965\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3965 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/23349-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/23349-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/23349-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/23349-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/23349-1.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/before-and-after\/?_sft_ll_bag_name=rhinoplasty\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Dr. Pearlman\u2019s Rhinoplasty Before and Afters<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q: On that note, what should someone expect during the rhinoplasty consultation process?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you should feel comfortable during the experience. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/consultation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consultation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is your time to ask questions and get to know your surgeon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes people come in and aren\u2019t really sure how to describe the results they want. They just know that they\u2019re unhappy with their current look and are wondering how <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/nose-plastic-surgery-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nose plastic surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help them feel more like themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our consultations at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we utilize 2-D Mirror Computer imaging and\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/vectra-3d-imaging\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vectra 3D imaging<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help our patients visualize their results. This lets us talk through different options for adjusting the nose and helps you visualize your results in real-time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With techniques like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/piezo-rhinoplasty\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piezo rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019re able to provide precise changes, which is especially useful in ethnic rhinoplasty, male rhinoplasty, and crooked nose procedures, where a patient might only want subtle changes to the hump or bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q: What common misconceptions do people have about getting rhinoplasty?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-4\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t break the nose the way you think, it\u2019s delicate and might not be needed at all<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing that comes to mind is that we still have patients who think that the nose gets violently broken during a rhinoplasty procedure, and that\u2019s just not true. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-rhinoplasty-surgeon-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can often be used to correct a broken nose that didn\u2019t set properly and changed shape. However, when we remove a large hump, it\u2019s like taking the top off a pyramid.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do delicate osteotomies to mobilize the nasal bones to close the open roof, otherwise, you would have a flat bridge. This does not prolong healing, increase post-op discomfort, or make the operation more dangerous. It takes about 3 minutes in a 2 \u00bd hour operation. It actually can make results better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We tailor every rhinoplasty surgery to the patient\u2019s unique needs and anatomy. We don\u2019t break the nose, but in some cases, we will cut and shape the bone to achieve the desired result. We might use small precise osteotomes or the piezo ultrasonic device.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"hdg-4\">You do really need to plan for recovery time.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes we have patients come in who are expecting to have their surgery and be back at work within a week. We always caution our patients to be realistic about how much time they need to plan to take off when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/recovering-from-rhinoplasty-nyc-experts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovering from rhinoplasty.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The longest part of recovery is waiting for the bruising to dissipate, which can take 1 to 2 weeks. Our patient care team makes sure to give a conservative estimate so you know what to expect. Women can usually be back at work in 1 \u00bd weeks with cover makeup.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extent of the bruising is dependent on the technique and your surgeon\u2019s technique. The face is a very delicate area, so you\u2019re not going to get away with zero bruising, but with a top rhinoplasty surgeon you might experience less severe discoloration.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some of the common questions you get as a TOP rhinoplasty surgeon?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-4\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long is it going to take me to recover after my surgery?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the questions we get are about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/recovering-from-rhinoplasty-nyc-experts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovering from rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

To feel really comfortable at an important social function, recovering from rhinoplasty takes about a month. Most patients will see 85% of their results at 1 month out, 95% of results at 6 months out, and 99% at 1 year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-4\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there going to be a scar?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We sometimes do closed, or scarless, rhinoplasty where there is no external incision. For open rhinoplasty, there is a tiny scar, but it\u2019s going to be unremarkable and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hard to see to the naked eye. In most cases, someone would have to be looking directly up your nostrils with a magnifying glass to see any scars left by open rhinoplasty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also have access to laser technology at our practice to fade the scar if necessary, and it rarely is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/open-vs-closed-which-rhinoplasty-technique-is-best\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn More About Open Vs Closed Rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-4\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is the best age to get a rhinoplasty?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> age to get a rhinoplasty.
