The skin thins by loss of collagen and fluid. In youth, the skin remains plump from a natural sugar called hyaluronic acid that attracts and binds to the body\u2019s water. Fillers are substances that are injected to fill in wrinkles and facial depressions that may come with age. With the advent of choices for facial fillers, we can choose the best for the specific problem and longevity.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The different types of FILLERS! - Pearlman Asthetic Surgery\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZEnTl8EIXWE?start=2&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">What do facial fillers fix?<\/h2>\n<p>There are now so many fillers available, we prefer to categorize them by their ideal usage. Fillers can be used to treat three conditions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Superficial fine lines<\/li>\n<li>Facial folds and crevasses<\/li>\n<li>Facial volume loss<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We all want fillers to last as long as possible, but don\u2019t want bumps from over-injecting. Gradual, precise and pointed is our method. The most superficial lines, those that appear \u201cetched\u201d into the skin require the thinnest fillers. As the need for more volume replacement increases, fillers are placed deeper and can be thicker. Medium thickness fillers are used for actual folds in the skin and deeper crevasses, such as the naso-labial folds. Naso-labial folds run from the corner of nose to the corner of the mouth. Medium depth fillers also may be very effective for melo-labial folds that run downward from the corners of the mouth to the jaw; otherwise referred to as \u201cmarionette\u201d lines. These thicker fillers are also longer lasting than the thin, superficial fillers.<\/p>\n<p>Since there are a number of available fillers for fine and deep wrinkles, both may be used in the same patient, and in conjunction with one another. We often layer fillers in the same areas in order to plump folds and fill the lines that may lie in the depths of those folds.<\/p>\n<p>The thickest fillers are more for volume enhancement for the face that needs to be \u201cplumped up.\u201d As the face ages, the cheeks get hollow in addition to droopy. Patients may need lifting as well as volume. In younger patients, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/face\/facelift-nyc\/\">facelifts<\/a> can often be delayed by filling the cheeks. This can actually give a small lift as well and is called the \u201c<a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/facial-fillers\/liquid-facelift\">Liquid Facelift<\/a>.\u201d Of course, nothing substitutes for a beautiful and professional facelift if it\u2019s a means to elevating jowls or excess skin under the neck. But we can go a long way in making you look more refreshed by starting with fillers.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Nasolabial Fold Fillers - Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FHoNvodXAOI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Facelift VS facial fillers<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">To lift or fill the face?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I recently saw a patient who came in because I did a facelift on one of her childhood friends and she liked what she saw: a more youthful look without looking \u201cpulled.\u201d She had a facelift about 7 years ago and feels that it helped a little but the skin of her lower face is \u201cwrinkley\u201d with some excess skin under the neck and cheek folds. She sought out a few opinions of other doctors and the suggestions ranged from fillers to implants to a revision facelift. My first inclination was to suggest another facelift. This would help the jowls and extra skin under her neck. What concerned me is that when listening to this lady, she was more distressed about the way the skin hung around her mouth and narrowing of her cheeks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;As a surgeon, facelifts are more interesting and fun for me to perform, plus this patient was basically asking if a revision facelift would be the best solution without specifically stating it. However, I felt that a facelift wouldn\u2019t be the best initial solution for her concerns. I suggested that we first try Sculptra to restore volume to her face and fill out the deflated cheeks and areas around her mouth. A facelift can be performed later to lift the drooping facial skin and muscles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;This is really about deciding priorities. I categorize facial aging into 5 categories: skin changes, dynamic muscle action, loss of volume, gravity and loss of elasticity. Everyone experiences all 5 as they age. It\u2019s more a matter of what should be addressed and in what order. For this patient, I feel it is volume first (high volume fillers with longevity \u2013 Sculptra) then combat gravity and loss of elasticity next (facelift). The face ages in 5 ways: skin, muscle action, volume loss, gravity and loss of elasticity. When the question is to fill or lift the face, both the doctor and patient need to determine the best treatment plan per the patients priorities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>&#8211; Steven J. Pearlman, MD, FACS<\/i><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-border-dk\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/contact\/\">Contact us<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Facial volume restoration<\/h2>\n<p>There are a number of options for facial volume restoration. The most natural technique is using one\u2019s own fat. The fat is re-injected immediately after removing it from elsewhere in the body. This technique is called lipo-transfer. However, we now use it less than we did a few years ago because lipo-transfer is similar to a surgical procedure in preparation and healing time.<\/p>\n<p>Plus there are a number of facial fillers available that can restore facial volume that may last for up to a year or more. These are Sculptra\u00ae, RADIESSE\u00ae, and the thinker Hyaluronic Acid products; JUVED\u00c9RM\u00ae Ultra Plus.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Injectable Fillers<\/h2>\n<p>There are many types of injectable fillers available today. The most popular fillers are made from hyaluronic acid (Restylane\u00ae, JUVED\u00c9RM\u00ae). Hyaluronic acid is a clear gel that already exists in the human body. It attracts water, hydrating your skin. Hyaluronic acid fillers have been safely used in Canada and Europe since 1996. Unlike many other fillers, Hyaluronic Acid is non-animal-based and poses no risk of animal disease transmission or allergic reaction.<\/p>\n<p>The hottest new application for Restylane\u00ae is to fill dark circles under the eyes. Often, dark circles are the result of fat bulging in the lower eyelid that is exaggerated by a hollow area called the \u201ctear trough.\u201d By placing Restylane\u00ae into this tear-trough, there is less shadow and therefore improvement in dark circles, making you look more rested and smooth.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/contact\/\">Contact us<\/a> today to learn more about how Restylane is one of the best under eye fillers.<\/p>\n<p>We also use RADIESSE\u00ae, a non-surgical facial contouring filler that delivers an immediate, longer lasting result. RADIESSE\u00ae may be thought of as a longer lasting filler for deep facial folds and may even be used for volume enhancement. RADIESSE\u00ae appears to last even longer than hyaluronic acid fillers for treatment of naso-labial folds and marionette lines. RADIESSE\u00ae provides immediate visual improvement common with other fillers, along with the benefit of long-lasting results. This is because RADIESSE\u00ae is made of very tiny, smooth calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) microspheres. These particles stimulate your own collagen to grow microspheres (particles) form a scaffold through which your body\u2019s own collagen grows.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-border-dk\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/gallery\/facial-fillers\/\">Results gallery<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Common Fillers<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"pt-50 hdg-4 hdg-5\">MEDIUM DEPTH FILLERS (MEDIUM WRINKLES):<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Restylane\u00ae<\/li>\n<li>JUV\u00c9DERM\u00ae Ultra XC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"pt-50 hdg-5\">DEEP FILLERS (VOLUME LOSS):<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/non-surgical\/facial-fillers\/restylane-lyft\">Restylane\u00ae Lyft\u2122<\/a><\/li>\n<li>JUV\u00c9DERM\u00ae Ultra Plus<\/li>\n<li>RADIESSE\u00ae; calcium hydroxyapetite.<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/facial-fillers\/sculptra\">Sculptra\u00ae<\/a>: Poly-L-Lactic Acid<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/facial-fillers\/juvederm-voluma-xc\">JUV\u00c9DERM VOLUMA\u00ae XC<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">LARGE VOLUME FILLERS &#8211; (WHEN PATIENTS REQUIRE A LARGER QUANTITY OF FACIAL VOLUME ENHANCEMENT)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fat lipotransfer; Spinning the patient\u2019s own fat in a centrifuge and then depositing very small amounts with each of multiple passes.

Cheek fillers are often composed of a thicker gel filler that holds its shape and has greater longevity than other fillers. Cheek fillers are an excellent option if you are looking to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restore volume to sagging or hollow looking cheeks<\/li>\n<li>Raise the height of your cheeks<\/li>\n<li>Add youthful looking plumpness to your cheeks<\/li>\n<li>Restore moisture and firmness to your cheeks<\/li>\n<li>Tighten and add definition to your jaw line<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Options for cheek fillers are those such as Juv\u00e9derm Voluma XC and Restylane Lyft.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">JAWLINE FILLERS<\/h3>\n<p>Jawline fillers are often hyaluronic acid-based fillers that are used to bring definition to your jawline and the areas at your jaw and chin. Even by lifting the cheeks, the jawline and face are given a subtle lift. During your consultation your facial structure will be assessed to determine exactly where to add fillers for the most natural-looking definition. Many people choose jawline fillers such as Juv\u00e9derm and Restylane products when they are looking to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add definition to the chin and jaw for a sharper and more sculpted facial appearance<\/li>\n<li>Add volume to the jawline to create greater balance and harmony<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">DEEP LINE FILLERS<\/h3>\n<p>Deep line fillers are typically hyaluronic based fillers such as Juv\u00e9derm XC, Juv\u00e9derm Vollure XC, and Restylane Fine Line-L and Restylane Refyne. These fillers come in different consistencies depending on the severity of your facial folds or wrinkles that are being treated. Areas that require more volume to be smoothed will require a thicker gel filler than an area with finer lines and wrinkles. If you are looking at smoothing out facial wrinkles, dermal fillers can benefit you by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding volume to areas with heavy lines, wrinkles and creases to give them a naturally smooth appearance<\/li>\n<li>Rejuvenating your face by increasing volume, moisture, and plumpness to your skin while smoothing it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\"><strong>FAQS<\/strong> facial fillers<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"styled pb-20\">\n<li>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">What are the different types of facial fillers?<\/h3>\n<p>There are many facial fillers on the market. The fillers we choose are used for the specific area being treated: lines, folds, crevasses or frank volume loss.
