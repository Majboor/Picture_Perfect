FACELIFT: WHICH IS FOR YOU?<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes down to correcting facial aging, you have many options ranging from non-invasive to minimally invasive to an actual surgical procedure. While all of these techniques aim to restore youthfulness and rejuvenate the face, the results they offer are not equal, and therefore the procedures should not be considered interchangeable. This is especially important between thread lift surgery and facelift surgery.<br \/>\nBoth the thread lift procedure and facelift surgery improve sagging skin on the jowls, cheeks, and neck. However, while these may treat similar signs of aging, they are not substitutes for each other, and the difference between these go far beyond the fact that one is minimally invasive and the other is surgery. While both of these procedures can leave you feeling younger and revitalized, each is distinctively designed for specific candidates. The hard part is determining which may be right for your level of facial aging.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title1\" class=\"hdg-3\">WHAT IS A THREAD LIFT?<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/silhouette-instalift\/\">Silhouette InstaLift\u2122<\/a>, also called a thread lift, improves the appearance of facial sagging and visible signs of aging with the use of dissolvable surgical threads. These threads work to \u201clift\u201d the underlying tissues of facial structures that have been impacted by gravity and the loss of collagen. Once these threads are inserted and anchored, collagen production is stimulated, which allows for lasting results. The Silhouette InstaLift\u2122 is non-surgical, minimally invasive, and provides natural-looking rejuvenation of your cheeks, jawline, and neck. We like to tell patients that you will get about 25 percent of the result of a surgical facelift with a thread lift.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title2\" class=\"hdg-3\">HOW DOES FACELIFT SURGERY DIFFER?<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike the Silhouette InstaLift\u2122 that uses the insertion of threads to mildly lift and tighten the underlying muscles, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/facelift\/\">facelift surgery<\/a> removes excess skin on the lower to midface while significantly tightening the muscles. Facelifts restore a more youthful appearance and can noticeably improve sagging jowls, vertical banding on the neck, and loss of volume in the midface. There are several levels of facelift surgery available depending on your needs. These range from the \u201cmini-lift\u201d that focuses on early signs of aging in the jowls and lower face to the \u201cdeep plane lift\u201d that provides extensive rejuvenation of the jawline, jowls, midface, cheeks, and neck.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title3\" class=\"hdg-3\">WHICH PROCEDURE ARE YOU A CANDIDATE FOR?<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2528\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignright\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2528\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Portrait-of-beautiful-healthy-happy-smiling-mature-woman-with-curly-hair-300x200-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Both of these procedures are suited for those in good physical health with realistic expectations. Candidates who have noticeable and significant aging indicators such as extensive sagging, deep creases, jowls, and drooping skin under the chin are likely best suited for facelift surgery. While the Silhouette InstaLift\u2122 will subtly reverse the early signs of aging, it cannot reach the same level of correction of traditional facelift surgery. The Silhouette InstaLift\u2122 is typically ideal for younger patients experiencing the onset of facial aging and skin laxity. These patients are those who wish to delay the need for surgery and want to combat the signs before they worsen. This procedure is also best for patients who have already undergone facelift surgery but require a \u201ctouch-up\u201d due to further skin laxity.<br \/>\n<em>Dr. Pearlman is a facial plastic surgeon who has been in practice for almost 30 years.
