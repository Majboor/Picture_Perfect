Although these wrinkles in men are part of the natural aging process, there are a lot of anti-aging resources available to help you\u00a0get rid of under eye wrinkles. But before we get into the best tips to get rid of crow\u2019s feet, here\u2019s a little more background information on crow\u2019s feet.<\/p>\n<p><b>What Are Crow\u2019s Feet?<\/b><br \/>\nCrow\u2019s feet are wrinkles around eyes that form as a result of a number of factors, smoking,\u00a0and everyday facial expressions are just two reasons for their appearance. These eye wrinkles are named as such because of their appearance: the fine lines resemble crow\u2019s feet. Unlike other wrinkles, undereye wrinkles require special attention because they reside in the delicate skin around eyes.<\/p>\n<p>This is where Botox comes to your rescue.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new use for Botox Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe lateral canthal lines, also known as\u00a0<i>crow\u2019s feet<\/i>, in adults. Botox is the only FDA approved drug treatment option for lateral canthal lines.<br \/>\nHere are some \u00a0great\u00a0anti-aging tips for men, you\u2019ll stay looking young and maintain your youthful complexion for years to come by getting rid of crow\u2019s feet.<\/p>\n<p><b>\u00a0<\/b><b>1. Use protection.\u00a0<\/b>Sun damage is a leading cause for premature aging signs and that includes eye wrinkles. Protect your eyes by wearing sunglasses when outside for an extended period of time. It\u2019s also helpful to use a\u00a0men\u2019s moisturizing sunblock\u00a0to protect against UVA\/UVB rays that could contribute to under eye wrinkles and other skin issues like age spots.<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Stop squinting.\u00a0<\/b>As mentioned earlier, facial expressions can contribute to the formation of under eye wrinkles. Let\u2019s be realistic, though: You\u2019re not going to be walking around emotionless for the rest of your life laugh, and smile to your heart\u2019s content. There is one thing you can work on, however, and that\u2019s squinting. Make sure you wear sunglasses outside and get the right prescription for your glasses if you need them. If you\u2019re having trouble focusing, you can also change your location (e.g. movie theater). The ultimate goal is to reduce eye strain.<\/p>\n<p><b>3. Drink more.<\/b>\u00a0Water, that is. Drinking enough water is crucial to healthy skin and keeps moisture levels balanced. A lack of moisture can lead to\u00a0dry skin, which result in premature aging signs in men like crow\u2019s feet.<\/p>\n<p><b>4. Use only the best men\u2019s anti-aging skin products for men.\u00a0<\/b>The skin around eyes should not be exposed to just any anti-aging skin products for men. This is delicate skin and it can become easily irritated because it\u2019s so thin. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to invest in only the\u00a0best men\u2019s anti-aging creams\u00a0that contain retinol. Studies have shown that retinol, a vitamin A derivative is one of the most effective ingredients to fight aging signs like eye wrinkles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under eye wrinkles, crow\u2019s feet, whatever you like to call them, one thing is for&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2610,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[241],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Beauty Expert &quot;Donna Fay&quot;
