Cosmetic surgery is still surgery. It inevitably involves anesthesia of some sort, be it local, twilight or general. That means patients need to have normal healing, clotting and must be medically able to tolerate surgery and anesthesia. There are well established pre-surgical testing requirements that have been set forth by the national Anesthesia society. For a young healthy person, it has been shown through studies that doing a stack of tests are not necessary. Age, sex and medical status standards determine what each potential patient needs to deem them safe for surgery and anesthesia.<\/p>\n<p>I have turned away a number of patients seeking <a title=\"Facelift\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blog\/proc_facelift.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"facelifts - link opens in new tab\/window\">facelifts<\/a> who are on medications for heart conditions and\/or have heart stents. This is because they cannot safely be off blood thinners for the necessary amount of time to heal normally from surgery. Some have begged me, or their primary care doctors, to take them off the blood thinners or operate on them anyway. Of course, I said no. This decision is really up to your primary care doctor. It is not worth looking good if there is a chance that you may have a heart attack, or worse.<\/p>\n<p>Cosmetic surgery is to make patients look better and to improve self image and self confidence. However, no matter how good you look after, if you have a poor sense of self image, surgery may not help. The best patients are those who are happy yet look to improve features that may detract, such as a big nose or jowls. Fixing this aesthetic flaw then restores or enhances self esteem. I often see personality changes that far outstrip the cosmetic changes, but this is as a result of, not a reason for cosmetic surgery.<\/p>\n<p>Over 15 years ago, I performed a <a title=\"Rhinoplasty\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blog\/proc_rhinoplasty.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"rhinoplasty - link opens in new tab\/window\">rhinoplasty<\/a> on a friend (at his insistence). He was extremely affable and a great person, plus the #1 salesman in the country for a large international corporation. So, he certainly didn\u2019t lack self confidence. After surgery, his professional confidence spilled over to his social being. He finally asked out the girl he admired from afar for years. They are now married with two children. I didn\u2019t make that much of a physical change, but the psychological change far outstripped what we did for his nose. He was able to apply that great personality to his social life.<\/p>\n<p>In reviewing some articles on patient selection for facial plastic surgery, they said that an educated patient is part of the criteria to be considered a good candidate. But given the media attention to cosmetic surgery and enhanced beauty, too much is not good either.\u00a0 Airbrushed celebrities and models don\u2019t help give accurate accounts of what they really look like. Actors can also take off months to hide and heal before appearing back in public (as they don\u2019t have 9 to 5, 52 weeks a year jobs to get back to right away). The internet is full of excellent information, forums and blogs, but not all of these are helpful. Sometimes too much information is not good. Details of a surgical procedure can sometimes be daunting and confusing to patients; especially when highly respected surgeons even differ. How can a non-physician make a choice? Also, unhappy patients tend to be more prolific on the internet than happy patients.<\/p>\n<p>Cosmetic surgery is an amazing way to enhance one\u2019s appearance for healthy well motivated patients. It\u2019s always a good tool to research your options but beware of misleading information from the internet. <a title=\"Dr. Pearlman bio\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blog\/aboutdoc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"Steven J.
