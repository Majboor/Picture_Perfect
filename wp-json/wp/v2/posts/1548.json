For these patients, a breast augmentation will not be enough to get the ideal breast shape. The volume is restored with an implant then the skin is tightened , the nipple lifted to an optimal position on the chest wall.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">BREAST REDUCTION + LIFT<\/h3>\n<p>All patients who receive a breast reduction receive a breast lift at the same time.<\/p>\n<h5>BREAST LIFT\/REDUCTION WITH LIPOSUCTION OF LATERAL CHEST AND BRA ROLL.<\/h5>\n<p>Sometimes a breast reduction or lift does not completely address fat rolls on the lateral chest and axilla (bra roll). After breast surgery, liposuction is commonly performed for these patients to flatten out the lateral chest fat and improve the final aesthetic.<\/p>\n<h5>BREST LIFT\/REDUCTION\/AUGMENTATION WITH TUMMY TUCK<\/h5>\n<p>This is the most common procedure we do at Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery. This was historically referred to as the \u201cmommy makeover\u201d but you don\u2019t need to have children to benefit from this procedure.

If this is the case make sure you are clear about the instructions.<\/li>\n<li>Do not take any supplemental medication that may increase bleeding risk (you will get a list of these before surgery)<\/li>\n<li>Pick up the medications at your local pharmacy that were prescribed by Dr. Stein. Please bring these medications with you the day of your surgery.<\/li>\n<li>Arrange for someone to bring you home after surgery and monitor you overnight (significant other\/family member\/friend). You should not be alone the first 3 days after your surgery.<\/li>\n<li>Buy Chlorhexidine body wash and shower with it for 5 days before your surgery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-4\">THE NIGHT BEFORE<\/h3>\n<p>Take it easy the day and night before surgery and avoid smoking, alcohol, and blood-thinning medications or supplements.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Bathe and wash yourself with antibacterial soap (Hibiclens)<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the day before surgery.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Get a good night\u2019s sleep (and if you have trouble sleeping, don\u2019t worry about it, it doesn\u2019t change anything.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-4\">THE DAY OF YOUR SURGERY<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shower the morning of surgery with hipaclens soap and dress in comfortable loose-fitting clothing. If you have compression stockings wear them to your surgery.<\/li>\n<li>Arrive on time.<\/li>\n<li>Let Dr. Stein know the morning of surgery if you have an allergy\/sensitivity to skin adhesives (tape).<\/li>\n<li>After checking in and changing into a gown, you will be positioned in a stretcher or chair where the anesthesiologist, nurses and surgeon will come and speak with you.

Take the bra off, as well as any loose gauze. Leave the underlying tape (stuck on dressing) intact over your breast incisions. They fall off by themselves around a week after your surgery. Shower normally over this tape. Allow water to run over incisions but don\u2019t scrub. Pat dry. You can shower daily afterwards and keep the incisions (with stuck-on dressings) exposed to air without gauze or bandages. Put your surgical bra on over any medical dressings and wear this at all times for 1 month after surgery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-4 hdg-5\">DRESSINGS AND DRAINS<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You may have 1 or 2 drains after surgery. Drains decrease swelling and collect excess fluid. The first is typically pulled a few days after surgery and the second around 1 week after surgery. To empty your drain at home sit in a comfortable chair with an empty cup beside you. Carefully undo the top so the suction is released and squeeze the fluid out into a cup. When the bulb is empty, squeeze it, then press in the stopper. Please the total volume of fluid that comes from each drain over each 24-hour period. Bring this record with you to each post operative appointment for Dr. Stein to review.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-4 hdg-5\">PHYSICAL ACTIVITY<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important for you to walk after surgery to decrease the chance of blood clots. Do everything slowly for the first 2 weeks after surgery. No intercourse for 2 weeks after surgery. No aerobic or weight exercises for 4 weeks after your surgery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"title7\" class=\"hdg-3\">THE UNIQUE SETTING AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE AT PEARLMAN AESTHETIC SURGERY<\/h2>\n<p>When looking for breast surgery near you, it\u2019s important to find a surgical clinic with superior providers and high-quality facilities.
