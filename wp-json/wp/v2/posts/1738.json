He didn&#8217;t overdo it with the fillers, which is good since it was my first time. Good results!\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title1\" class=\"hdg-3\">WHAT IS A NON-SURGICAL RHINOPLASTY<\/h2>\n<p>As the central feature of the face, the nose will draw significant attention either positively or negatively. When the nose fits harmoniously with the rest of the face, the eyes will be drawn to the smile, creating a positive first impression.<\/p>\n<p>Those who are unhappy with the shape or size of their nose, and who wish to change the bridge, the tip, the nostrils or all three of these components may find themselves researching a surgical rhinoplasty.<\/p>\n<p>While a surgical rhinoplasty can achieve long-term improvements as well as correction of blocked airways, not everyone is ready for this daunting approach. Some patients will be apprehensive at the higher risks and longer downtimes, not to mention the physical discomfort of recovery.<\/p>\n<p>For these folks, there is a wonderful, non-invasive solution known as a non-surgical rhinoplasty, available at Dr. Pearlman&#8217;s NYC office. It is performed using a variety of dermal fillers such as Juvederm, Sculptra, and Radiesse that can reshape irregular nasal contours, provide more definition to the nose, smooth away a hump, or balance out a curved nose.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Pearlman&#8217;s non-surgical rhinoplasty is effective in treating:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bumps on the nasal bridge<\/li>\n<li>Pinched nasal tips<\/li>\n<li>Indentations<\/li>\n<li>Bulbous nasal tips<\/li>\n<li>Long-hanging columella<\/li>\n<li>Retracted columella<\/li>\n<li>Asymmetrical or crooked noses<\/li>\n<li>Wide nostrils<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-border-dk\" href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/contact\/\">Contact Us<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title2\" class=\"pb-40-desktop pb-20-tablet hdg-3\">WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF NON-SURGICAL RHINOPLASTY?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-permanent: since dermal fillers are temporary, the patient has the freedom to change their mind in the future about the look of their nose.<\/li>\n<li>Cost-effective: a non-surgical rhinoplasty is far less costly than its surgical counterpart.<\/li>\n<li>Natural-looking results: results can be enjoyed immediately and appear very organic.<\/li>\n<li>No downtime: There is no anesthesia, so patients can return to their normal activities right away after treatment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Non-surgical rhinoplasty certainly sounds novel, doesn\u2019t it? This exciting and very effective procedure uses facial fillers to camouflage a hump, raise a low bridge, and can even help make the tip of the nose project outward. What is cannot do is make the nose or large bump smaller. By filling above and sometimes below the hump on a nose, the hump will be less prominent, looking more symmetrical and pleasing to the eye. However, the overall nose will also be larger. Computer imaging is a good way to determine if a non-surgical rhinoplasty will look good on you or will it just make your nose appear bigger.<\/p>\n<p>Raising a low bridge is becoming very popular with Asian patients. They tend to have weak tips that can also be brought out with filler. For drooping tips, a little Botox in the muscle just under the base of the nose may even raise the tip of the nose. I have performed this on one of my staff members, who is officially \u201caddicted\u201d!<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1742\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1742 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/nose-diagram.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/nose-diagram.png 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/nose-diagram-300x103.png 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/nose-diagram-768x263.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-border-dk\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/gallery\/\">Gallery<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title3\" class=\"child left-border hdg-3\">HOW LONG WILL MY RESULTS LAST?<\/h2>\n<p>Your results will be evident for approximately 6 months, at which point you can return to Dr. Pearlman\u2019s NYC office for a touch-up.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title4\" class=\"hdg-3\">IS A NON-SURGICAL NOSE JOB RIGHT FOR ME?<\/h2>\n<p>You are a good candidate for our non-surgical nose job if you are experiencing dissatisfaction with the appearance of your nose, but do not wish to undergo an invasive procedure. If you desire a painless, quick option for improving your image, Dr. Pearlman can meet with you to discuss the non-surgical rhinoplasty and how it can redefine your look. Bear in mind that those with a broken or severely crooked nose will most likely require surgery.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">WHAT IS THE COST OF A NON-<span class=\"block-tablet-down hdg-3\">SURGICAL RHINOPLASTY?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Non-surgical rhinoplasty typically starts at around $4500, but this will vary based on the complexity of the work performed, and on how many areas are injected. Dr. Pearlman will provide you with a detailed quote at the time of your convenient New York City consultation. We work with all our patients to secure a financing option that works for your budget.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title6\" class=\"hdg-3\">WHAT WILL MY RECOVERY BE LIKE?<\/h2>\n<p>Because there are no incisions, scars or anesthesia used, the non-surgical rhinoplasty does not entail any significant downtime. Patients can get up and continue their day as planned after their non-surgical nose job. Some minor tenderness, discoloration and swelling are to be expected, but these will resolve within a week or two. Results typically last around 10-12 months on average, but in some cases results have been known to last up to two years.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Pearlman suggests that you refrain from wearing heavy sunglasses for several weeks to allow the skin to heal, and that you abstain from vigorous exercise and alcohol for at least 24 hours after your injections.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">WHY SHOULD I CHOOSE DR. PEARLMAN FOR NON-SURGICAL RHINOPLASTY?<\/h2>\n<p>While non-surgical rhinoplasty involves fewer risks and shorter downtimes, it requires the same level of artistry, detail and precision that a surgical procedure does. For this reason, it is essential that you select a board certified plastic surgeon such as Dr. Pearlman to create the most natural-looking results possible. Dr. Pearlman has been delivering outstanding patient care and exquisite facial contouring results for decades. He takes a keen interest in each client he works with, taking the time to fully understand their goals and aesthetic preferences so he can provide a customized, elegant outcome.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TESTIMONIAL \u201cDr. Pearlman listened to my concerns and then took care of them.
