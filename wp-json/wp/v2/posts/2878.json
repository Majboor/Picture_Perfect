The truth about who is having plastic surgery might surprise you.<\/p>\n<p>It is assumed that women who go under the knife are vain. While some opt for surgery strictly to look better, the truth is that many choose surgery for self-esteem. Women who are self-conscious about their bodies gain a tremendous amount of confidence when they feel in control. They may not be able to alter certain traits, but they can fix a crooked nose or breasts they feel are too small.<\/p>\n<p>Looking better is only one part of the equation. Feeling better is the goal.<\/p>\n<p>If it seems that Hollywood is the only place cosmetic surgery exists, that is not the case. While celebrities who choose a surgical fix are some of the most obvious plastic surgery patients, they aren\u2019t alone. The average Jane takes this route more than movie stars do each year, and surgical suites are full of people who have never seen a movie set or been on television.<br \/>\nA florist in Florida is more likely than a blockbuster star on the Walk of Fame to seek cosmetic surgery.<\/p>\n<p>When you think of plastic surgery, do you think it\u2019s only for the wealthy?<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that people of all income levels choose surgical enhancement. Surveys conducted on those inquiring about surgery found that roughly 40% of reported their annual income was $30,000-$60,000 a year. Surprisingly, almost 30% reported incomes of less than $30,000. Only 13% reported income of over $90,000 a year. Clearly, not only the well-off are opting to beautify their bodies. It could be the cashier checking your groceries just as easily as the banker driving the luxury sedan.<\/p>\n<p>Movies and television give the impression that surgical enhancement is just for women. The truth is more men are now choosing to get a little work done themselves. While still in the minority, men are having procedures for social and professional benefit. Typically, men opt for more subtle procedures, such as hair plugs, injectable wrinkle fillers, liposuction, and minor facial enhancements, such as a brow lift.<\/p>\n<p>Patients feel great once their procedures are healed. They are happy and confident, but perhaps unaware that most results are not meant to last a lifetime. Aging will still occur, as nothing can freeze the hands of time or the work of gravity. To keep that desired post-surgical look, upkeep or repeated procedures will be necessary. Injectable fillers last a few months, a full face-lift has a lifespan of about 10 years, breast implants made need to be replaced every decade, while a reduction will be affected by weight gain, loss or pregnancy.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over a million people have cosmetic procedures each year, and there are many misconceptions about&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":877,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[240],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Top Misconceptions About Plastic Surgery &bull;
