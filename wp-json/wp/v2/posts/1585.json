For example, when did you last feel the need to don your office best? Slacks, a button up, blouse or a suit? When will it be necessary to do so again?<\/p>\n<p>But just as work-from-home culture has been thriving, so too has the cosmetic industry. In fact, for many, business is booming. Patients have been clamoring for \u201cdiscreet\u201d facelifts and nose jobs, since they no longer have to go out in public \u2014 at least, not without a mask on \u2014 a mask that happens to conceal most of the commonly treated areas.<\/p>\n<p>Why the sudden increased rate in cosmetic procedures and nose jobs?<\/p>\n<p>The stay-at-home culture caused by the pandemic has made us more aware of our facial asymmetries (given us more time to gaze into the mirror); and provides us the perfect opportunity to make major upgrades, in secrecy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cZoom Face Envy\u201d is probably one of the biggest reasons for the massive upsurge in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/rhinoplasty\/\">nose jobs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/facelift-nyc\/\">facelifts<\/a>. As people spend hours looking at themselves and each other on hi-def flat screens, in non-studio lighting and at odd camera angles, they\u2019re made more aware of their facial imperfections, crystallizing a deep-seated desire to enhance their appearance.<\/p>\n<p>Zoom Face Envy also finds a perfect vehicle for action in a time when we\u2019re all at home anyway. What better time to relax and recover, when stay-at-home is already en vogue?<\/p>\n<p>Before the pandemic, people considering facelifts and nose jobs may have held back for several reasons. Cosmetic surgeries typically involve a recovery period, so you\u2019d have to take time off work. It also might have been next to impossible to conceal a nose job <em>before<\/em> the pandemic struck.<\/p>\n<p>But now, we\u2019re living and working out of our homes and staying away from public places anyway. We\u2019re spending less money on vacations, cultural activities and restaurants, and putting those savings towards personal care. It\u2019s the perfect time to make massive upgrades without anyone being the wiser.<\/p>\n<p>Nose jobs have seen the biggest surge, followed closely by facelifts.<\/p>\n<p>Before COVID-19, some reports suggested invasive cosmetic surgeries like rhinoplasty and facelift were giving way in favor of dermal fillers and injectable enhancements. Since 2000, the number of minimally-invasive injectable treatments had risen by 878%.<\/p>\n<p>The primary reason for that statistical shift is obvious \u2014 dermal fillers don\u2019t include downtime, but facelifts and rhinoplasties include a significant recovery period. As such, patients preferred to seek regular injections to maintain their results rather than opt for cosmetic surgeries that would be evident.<\/p>\n<p>Coronavirus-times have changed that \u2014 cosmetic surgeries are back on the rise. Currently, the most popular cosmetic surgery is rhinoplasty, followed by eyelid lifts and facelifts. So, why nose jobs, i.e., rhinoplasties?<\/p>\n<p>Rhinoplasty transforms one\u2019s entire facial symmetry, bringing balance, beauty and proportion into facial structure. Cosmetic surgeons agree that rhinoplasties also produce some of the most pronounced changes to your facial appearance.<\/p>\n<p>If you go out in public after rhinoplasty, you can simply pull your mask up, and that\u2019s it \u2014 no questions asked.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that the pandemic has been a black cloud looming over the world\u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t find a silver lining. Is there any part of your face that you\u2019ve always wanted to change? Are you unhappy with your facial or nasal appearance? If so, surprisingly enough, a global pandemic is the perfect time to make the transformation you\u2019ve always wanted.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Pearlman is dual board certified in Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Head and Neck Surgery.
