While prevention is key to reducing early onset of fine lines and wrinkles, sometimes people are too late in realizing the importance of preventative measures. Understanding the causes can help, but for those who have already developed forehead wrinkles, there are treatments Dr. Pearlman offers that can help restore a more youthful appearance.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title1\" class=\"hdg-3\">CAUSES<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">AGING<\/h3>\n<p>Two building blocks are key to keeping skin young and fresh in appearance: elastin and collagen. As we age, elastin begins to break down in the body and face, while collagen production gradually decreases. As a result, our bodies do not replenish themselves as efficiently as they did when we were younger.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">SUN EXPOSURE<\/h3>\n<p>Prolonged exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays increases the destruction of collagen fibers in the skin. The basic structure of these collagen fibers are destroyed, which causes laxity of the skin. When the skin can no longer bounce back, wrinkles, sagging, and other problems follow.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">SMOKING<\/h3>\n<p>A smoking habit can cause wrinkles to form about 10 years earlier than non-smokers. Smoking cigarettes causes a 60 percent reduction in vitamin C blood levels, and since vitamin C is the key component responsible for the production of collagen fibers, smokers often find their skin less elastic and more brittle than non-smokers.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">INADEQUATE HYDRATION<\/h3>\n<p>Our bodies are made up of mostly water. When an individual does not consume enough water throughout the day, many areas of the body are affected, but our skin is the most apparent. Hydrated skin looks fresh, plump, and full of life, so staying hydrated is an important part of preventing wrinkles and fine lines on the face.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">IMPROPER DIET<\/h3>\n<p>A diet that lacks proper nutrients cannot build the necessary structures of the skin. The skin is the largest organ of the body, and as such, requires a large amount of vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and antioxidants to thrive. Without proper nutrition, the connective tissues of the skin begin to break down and lose elasticity. A diet full of vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables can delay the signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">LACK OF SLEEP<\/h3>\n<p>Getting adequate sleep is equally as important as a healthy diet and proper hydration. During the deepest stage of sleep, a growth hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland, which aids in the renewal of body tissue.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">STRESS<\/h3>\n<p>Emotional stress that is prolonged for an extended amount of time causes an increased secretion of stress hormones and accelerates the aging process. This can inhibit connective tissue regeneration and affect an array of bodily processes.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">EXAGGERATED FACIAL MOVEMENTS<\/h3>\n<p>Some people are more animated in their facial expressiveness than others. Excessive frowning and other dramatic expressions can cause wrinkles to form on the forehead as aging progresses.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title2\" class=\"hdg-3\">TREATMENTS<\/h2>\n<p>While a healthy lifestyle can delay the signs of aging, some people do not realize its importance until the damage to the skin has already been done. As we continue to age, wrinkles on the forehead begin to become more apparent. Luckily, Dr. Pearlman provides treatments that can help minimize or correct wrinkles on the forehead.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">BOTOX\u00ae COSMETIC<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/botox\/\">BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic<\/a> treatments are minimally invasive and performed in the office. A series of small botulinum toxin type A injections help minimize wrinkles on the forehead. Repeated BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic treatments can help to prevent and permanently reduce wrinkles. Injections typically last three to four months on average and help retrain the facial muscles. As BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic treatments are repeated, forehead wrinkles tend to come back finer and less noticeable. Eventually, with enough treatments, they may not come back at all.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">BROW LIFT<\/h3>\n<p>Forehead rejuvenation is possible with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/brow-lift\/\">brow lift surgery<\/a>. During your brow lift, or forehead lift, Dr. Pearlman removes excess skin on the forehead and repositions the muscles underneath to restore a smoother, more youthful contour to the upper portion of the face. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia on an outpatient basis. Bruising and swelling are common for up to 10 days and sutures, which are hidden in the hairline, are removed after one week. Patients are able to return to work after one week, but strenuous activities should be avoided to promote healing. After two to four weeks, the patient may resume all normal activities, including exercise.<br \/>\n<em>To set up a consultation or for more information regarding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/botox\/\">BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/brow-lift\/\">brow lift surgery<\/a> with Board-Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon Dr. Steven J.
