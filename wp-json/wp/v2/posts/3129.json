Well, I am going to revive this tradition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">My summer started off with a few medical seminars. Boring? Not really. I actually enjoy speaking at meetings and teaching. Giving a lecture to doctors in my own specialty keeps me at the top of my game, since I need to give information that they will feel is useful and worth having spent the time and money to come to the meeting. In early June I spoke on Rhinoplasty and facial aging at a seminar in Las Vegas at the Multi-Specialty Foundation for Facial Plastic Surgery. There were over 500 facial plastic surgery specialists at that meeting. Two weeks later, I was on the faculty for the AAFPRS (American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery) semi-annual course in rhinoplasty held in Boston. This course is considered by many to be the premiere rhinoplasty course of the year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Just two weeks later my wife and I traveled to Los Angeles to spend the 4<sup>th<\/sup>of July holiday with my in-laws. L.A. is a great place to visit. I got to combine all my passions: family, friends, golf and facial plastic surgery. The trip started with a mellow 4<sup>th<\/sup> where we got to watch the fireworks from Gladstones; a timeless beachside restaurant. Friday, I spent some time visiting with a friend and fellow facial plastic surgeon, Dr. Raj Kanodia. I had the opportunity to observe him performing surgery and learned why he has become one of the most sought after rhinoplasty surgeons on the west coast.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Later that day, I played a round of golf with a friend of the family, and brilliant physician, Dr. Marty Gordon and a surprise guest, our mutual friend Dr. Bill Binder. By coincidence, Bill is a friend of Marty\u2019s as well as having attended the same residency program that I did. Bill happens to be my personal \u201cguru\u201d when it comes to facial implants.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Saturday, was a little quieter, we spent the afternoon at Dr. Andrew Frankel\u2019s pool with his wife and two fabulous children. Yes, another accomplished facial plastic surgeon, L.A. rising star and good friend. That night was a barbecue at my in-laws with a few of their friends. As always, a few \u2018celebs\u2019 dropped by. After living in LA for over 30 years, my in-laws certainly know a lot of people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Sunday was another round of golf, with yes you guessed it, another friend and skilled facial plastic surgeon, Dr. Paul Nassif. By coincidence, we played at the very same course as I did on Friday, Wilshire Country Club, although this time I scored much better than I did on Friday.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">In early August, we spent a week (actually my wife was there for a week, I spent Thursday afternoon through Monday night) in Shelter Island. It was a very relaxing time; sitting at the beach, hanging with my brother, sister in law and good friends, reading and enjoying the beautiful surrounds of Shelter Island. We had the good fortune to spend two more weekends on Shelter Island, one in the early summer and the second in September. The latter was to attend the wedding of my close friend and celebrity cosmetic Dermatologist, Dr. Howard Sobel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Now that the summer is over, it\u2019s time to spend more time at home. This is perfect timing since my wife and I are expecting twins very soon. Keep posted for updates on the twins. I hope you all have a great fall, I know mine will be!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember the \u201cold days\u201d when this was an annual composition that you wrote in school&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3130,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[242],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What I Did On My Summer Vacation &bull;
