During this time he\u2019ll ask you questions about your general health, examine your facial anatomy, and make a recommendation on whether you\u2019re a good candidate for buccal fat removal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to make the most of your consultation and ask any questions you have about the procedure. This is also when we\u2019ll take your before photos.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Procedure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheek fat removal is an outpatient procedure that uses local anesthetic unless it\u2019s being performed with a facelift or another procedure. If you\u2019re having any anxiety or worry we can also give you some sedation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman will make a small incision on the inside of each cheek in your mouth. Then, he\u2019ll place pressure on the outside of the cheek to maneuver the unwanted buccal fat out through the incision. This excess fat is then removed. Once this is done, he\u2019ll close the incisions with a few dissolvable sutures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recovery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After your procedure you\u2019ll be given a set of detailed aftercare instructions to help with your recovery period. Most patients are able to return to their normal activities within a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can expect some swelling that should be manageable with medication. It\u2019s possible that there may be some bruising, too. It will take about 1 week to feel completely back to normal.\u00a0 Because the incisions are made inside your mouth, there will be no visible scarring on the face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Results will improve over time as your body continues to heal. While you\u2019ll be able to see the initial results immediately, the final results are usually visible after a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequently asked questions about cheek fat removal in NYC<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is buccal fat removal permanent?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buccal fat removal is permanent, once the fat is gone, it\u2019s gone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to consider whether this surgery is the best option for your aesthetic goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there an ideal age for buccal fat removal?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Dr. Pearlman doesn\u2019t typically perform buccal surgery for patients much under the age of 30. Your face is still changing in your 20s and your buccal fat is naturally going to get smaller as you age. Removing it too early can cause premature aging or gauntness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if I don\u2019t like the results of my buccal surgery?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman works closely with his patients to ensure they\u2019ll be happy with your results. However, if you had your surgery done elsewhere or just changed your mind a few years later, we can use strategic <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facial-fillers-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facial filler<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/sculptra-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sculptra injections<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to replace the lost volume.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there alternatives to buccal fat removal?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buccal fat is usually resistant to diet and exercise but generally decreases with age. We can use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facial-fillers-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facial fillers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to add definition to your cheek above and jawbones below to provide a more contoured look, drawing attention away from your buccal fat.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does buccal fat removal age you?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When done at the appropriate age and on an ideal candidate, buccal fat removal won\u2019t age you. It will provide more defined cheekbones and a more contoured facial structure. If buccal fat is removed too early it can result in more skin laxity or gauntness as you age.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I get buccal fat removal at the same time as other procedures?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes! Buccal fat removal can be completed during other surgical procedures like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/neck-lift-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neck lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It can be complimented well with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/lip-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lip fillers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facial-fillers-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facial fillers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering cheek fat removal in NYC?
