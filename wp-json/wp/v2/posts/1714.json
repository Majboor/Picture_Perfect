So it&#8217;s good that you\u2019re doing your research on the procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two different approaches to reshaping the nose: open rhinoplasty and closed rhinoplasty. One of the most confusing dilemmas presented while in the research phase is deciding what technique to use to obtain the best results. It is always good for patients to become well-informed about procedure options so that you can make the right decision about your health and appearance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we empower our patients to make the most informed decision possible when it comes to open vs closed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-rhinoplasty-surgeon-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Each technique has its own set of advantages and disadvantages that we encourage you to discuss with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before moving forward with your<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/rhinoplasty\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rhinoplasty surgery in New York City<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will always help you achieve stunning results that work for you. This means educating patients on the treatment options of an open vs closed rhinoplasty and offering <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expert insight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on which rhinoplasty technique would work best for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open vs closed rhinoplasty | Open<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery, we perform open rhinoplasty when we feel it is indicated on some of our patients, also referred to as external rhinoplasty, by making a small incision on the columella, the soft tissue that separates the nostrils. This technique allows for easy access to the underlying bone and cartilage structure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary benefit of the open technique is that it allows for improved accuracy in reshaping the framework of the nose to achieve desired contouring. By completely opening the surface of the nose, Dr. Pearlman is afforded more straightforward access to the treatment area, especially for very crooked noses, complex revision rhinoplasty and when unique procedures will be necessary for the nasal tip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open technique is best used when considering a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/revision-rhinoplasty-in-new-york\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revision rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because the original structure of the nose has already been disturbed during the original procedure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman may also use the open technique if the patient\u2019s nose is crooked or to achieve a marked reduction in nasal tip projection (how far the tip sticks out from the face). This is because the open technique provides more clear access to the surgical site as well as clarity and ease for intricate suturing and\/or grafting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scarring from this technique is barely visible and will usually fade with time.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4871\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_1924\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 636px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1924\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/african-rhinoplasty-patient-3-1-300x199.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"636\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/african-rhinoplasty-patient-3-1-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/african-rhinoplasty-patient-3-1-768x510.png 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/african-rhinoplasty-patient-3-1.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open vs closed rhinoplasty | Closed<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closed rhinoplasty, also referred to as endonasal rhinoplasty or scarless rhinoplasty, is performed by making all necessary incisions completely hidden within the nostrils.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman performs the procedure through separate surgical openings in the left and right nostrils. With no external incisions, the closed technique is less invasive and creates no visible scarring at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of the columellar incision (across the bottom of the nose) results in slightly less swelling during recovery and potentially less downtime overall. However, the limited access allowed during a closed rhinoplasty makes manipulation and complex reshaping of the tip of the nose a bit more difficult.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman can achieve equal results using a closed approach and an open approach. He uses the closed approach in a little over half of his primary rhinoplasties. He will discuss which technique is best for you during your consultation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3971\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_3918\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 636px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3918\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/x1001-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"636\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/x1001-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/x1001-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/x1001-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/x1001-1.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open vs closed rhinoplasty | Which is best?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practical difference between the two techniques is small, but the results are important. Without the columellar incision, the closed technique allows for faster operation and less swelling during the recovery period.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, an open rhinoplasty allows for more precision for difficult noses and when altering the nasal structures for more complex cases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should consider an <\/span><b>open<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rhinoplasty if\u2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be a revision rhinoplasty<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your rhinoplasty is particularly complex<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is necessary to reshape the tip of your nose<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nose is especially crooked<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should consider a <\/span><b>closed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rhinoplasty if\u2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re very concerned about scarring<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have less time in your schedule for recovery<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your rhinoplasty is less focused on the tip of the nose<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 30 years of experience performing well over 7,000 rhinoplasty surgeries, you can rest assured that Dr. Pearlman is an expert in performing both open vs closed rhinoplasty techniques.

The goal with this type of enhancement is to leave friends wondering what new makeup or hair style you must be using to look so revitalized.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, your results will not come across as \u201cplastic\u201d or \u201coverdone.\u201d Dr. Pearlman is excellent at ensuring that your new feature fits perfectly to your facial balance in a way that looks completely natural.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you break the bones in the nose during rhinoplasty?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hss.edu\/condition-list_osteotomy.asp#:~:text=An%20osteotomy%20is%20a%20surgery,various%20orthopedic%20conditions%20and%20injuries.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">osteotomies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are necessary. In some cases, we may carefully cut and reset the bones to achieve the desired shape and profile we discussed during your consultation. Osteotomies do not increase post-op pain, hinder healing, or affect the strength of the nose once healed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also may use more modern techniques such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/ultrasonic-rhinoplasty-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piezo ultrasonic powered rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/preservation-rhinoplasty-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preservation rhinoplasty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during your procedure to avoid osteotomies as well if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try our virtual rhinoplasty tool!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re considering a rhinoplasty, we\u2019ve got just the tool for you.
