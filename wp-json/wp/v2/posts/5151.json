They\u2019re also usually the first place to show signs of aging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagging eyelids not only make us look older than we feel, but they can also start to impair our vision as we age. Anyone who is bothered by sagging eyelids, puffy eyes, discoloration or undereye bags may be an excellent candidate for a blepharoplasty in NYC. Also known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/eyelid-surgery-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eyelid surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, blepharoplasty can be used to restore a youthful look and provide overall rejuvenation to the eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel bothered by the ways aging has affected your eyes, it\u2019s time to explore the options of blepharoplasty with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Steven Pearlman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a dual board-certified facial plastic surgeon and founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What causes eye wrinkles?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your eyes move a lot throughout the day, between your natural blinks, squinting against the sunlight, laughing, crying, and side eyeing that one person in your spin class who shows off a little too much. The skin is also half as thick as the rest of the face so it ages more rapidly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The muscles around your eyes are responsible for our facial expressions; they\u2019re moving all the time. As we age and our skin starts to change, wrinkles start to appear because of these muscle movements. That\u2019s why we end up with frown lines and crow&#8217;s feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many smaller areas that contribute to the overall appearance of your eyes, part of your consultation for blepharoplasty in NYC will be about determining the cause of your aging eyes. At Pearlman Aesthetic surgery we can use both surgical and non-surgical methods for eyelid rejuvenation to help you achieve optimal results based on your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does a blepharoplasty treat?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A blepharoplasty is a surgical procedure that can remove excess fat, bags, skin, and\/or muscle from your upper or lower eyelids.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-4 hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upper blepharoplasty<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you age, your upper eyelids can actually begin to stretch as the muscles supporting them weaken, allowing excess skin and fat to gather beneath them. An <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/upper-blepharoplasty-in-nyc\/\">upper blepharoplasty<\/a> makes an incision in the natural fold of your eyelid, removes the excess tissue, and creates a more open-looking eye.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower Blepharoplasty<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For patients who are dealing with puffiness and bags under their eyes, a lower blepharoplasty can reduce the fine lines and wrinkles created by loose skin. We often perform a lower eyelid surgery by preserving the fat that was bulging and creating the bags, then re-positioning it into the hollow area beneath called the tear trough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since aging tends to affect the whole eye area, many patients will benefit from having both an upper and lower blepharoplasty. It\u2019s also possible to combine a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/brow-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/lip-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lip lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a blepharoplasty in NYC at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Dr. Pearlman can help you determine if a brow lift or blepharoplasty is better for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_861\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-861 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Dr.-Pearlman-Surgical-Consultations-6667-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Dr.-Pearlman-Surgical-Consultations-6667-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Dr.-Pearlman-Surgical-Consultations-6667-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Dr.-Pearlman-Surgical-Consultations-6667-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Dr.-Pearlman-Surgical-Consultations-6667-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Dr.-Pearlman-Surgical-Consultations-6667.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can I expect from blepharoplasty in NYC?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you schedule your blepharoplasty with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can expect to be supported from consultation, to recovery, and beyond.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in any plastic surgery procedure is an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/consultation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in-depth consultation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which provides the basis for a successful plastic surgery experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During your consultation, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will get to know you and your aesthetic goals. He\u2019ll go over your medical history, examine the treatment area, discuss which treatment options will best suit you, and answer any questions you have about the procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ll look through before and after photos so that you can have clear expectations for your blepharoplasty. We\u2019ll also take your photos so that you can see your own changes, too!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procedure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blepharoplasty is an outpatient procedure and an upper blepharoplasty is often performed using only local anesthetic. For a lower blepharoplasty, or if we\u2019re combining with another procedure like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/brow-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you might prefer deeper anesthesia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make blepharoplasty scars as inconspicuous as possible, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes incisions in the natural creases of the eyelids and sometimes inside the lower eyelid to hide them. After your blepharoplasty in NYC, it won\u2019t look like you had surgery, your eyes will look naturally wider and refreshed. The incisions can be hidden with eyeshadow and eyeliner as you heal and are barely visible when fully healed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Results<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blepharoplasty provides subtle results with a big impact.

Of course, the aging process will continue. That&#8217;s why it\u2019s important to keep up with medical grade skin care, Botox, and filler to help maintain your results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you need to know about recovering from blepharoplasty:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/plastic-surgeons-in-new-york-city\/stefanie-dailey\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">patient care team<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will provide you with detailed and thorough guidelines for your post-surgery care.

Get plenty of rest (keep your head elevated!), hydrate, and wear sunglasses to help reduce your healing time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most patients feel like returning to most activities within about a week to a week an a half when most of the bruising and swelling has gone down. If you wear contacts, you\u2019ll be able to resume wearing them about 2 weeks after your procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequently asked questions about blepharoplasty in NYC<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How old do I need to be to get a blepharoplasty?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no \u201cbest\u201d age to undergo an eyelid lift, most of our blepharoplasty patients are in their 40s or beyond. Some people may decide to undergo the procedure in their 30s and occasionally even in their 20s if they have naturally hooded eyes or premature lower eyelid bags.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there nonsurgical alternatives to eyelid surgery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While nothing can replace the results of surgery, there are some aesthetic treatments that can help rejuvenate the eyes, too. Strategic <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/botox-in-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Botox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facial-fillers-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filler injections<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help alleviate wrinkles and replace lost volume. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/ultherapy-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultherapy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, microneedling and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/laser-skin-rejuvenation-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">laser skin rejuvenation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can stimulate collagen and new skin growth, which reduces the appearance of wrinkles, leading to more refreshed eye area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can I combine my blepharoplasty with other plastic surgery?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes! Patients will often elect to receive a blepharoplasty alongside a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/brow-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/lip-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lip lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and even rhinoplasty. A facelift only lifts the lower \u2154 of the face.
