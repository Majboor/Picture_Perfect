The forehead and eye area are prone to developing wrinkles and sagging skin that can contribute to an aging, tired, and sad appearance. If it is time for you to take the plunge for facial rejuvenation, you may be wondering whether you would benefit from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/brow-lift\/\">brow lift<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blepharoplasty\/\">blepharoplasty<\/a>. For a quick summary, if you feel you look \u201ctired,\u201d you are more likely a candidate for upper blepharoplasty. If you are asked if you are \u201cangry,\u201d you may be more of a candidate for a brow lift. The following indicators will help you understand which procedure you need (or whether you may need both) to achieve the most desirable aesthetic outcome.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title1\" class=\"hdg-3\">BROW LIFT SURGERY<\/h2>\n<p>Brow lift surgery is a procedure that rejuvenates the upper face by addressing forehead wrinkles and sagging brows. Using either an endoscopic approach or a modification of the traditional coronal lift technique, Dr. Pearlman elevates the forehead and the brows to rejuvenate their appearance. Dr. Pearlman recognizes the general differences in male and female eyebrows and is careful to raise them appropriately when performing brow lift surgery. As a result of this surgery, the forehead will lie smoother and the brows will appear more lifted and natural. Brow lift surgery often eliminates upper face wrinkles and can correct upper eyelid hooding that was caused by sagging brows.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">CANDIDATES FOR BROW LIFT SURGERY<\/h3>\n<p>If the overhang or hooding of your upper eyelids extends beyond the corner of your eyes, then you are certainly more of a candidate for a brow lift. Another indicator is the shape of your eyebrows; if they are flat or the tail is even lower than the central part of the brow, a brow lift will help restore a youthful arch. A candidate for a brow lift will have experienced a distinct drop in the forehead over time and flattening of the arch that has led to sagging brows. If sagging brows have also led to upper eyelid hooding, a brow lift will be able to reverse it. If you look back at an old photograph of yourself and see that the position of your eyebrows has changed over time, you may be a good candidate for this procedure. You may also be a candidate if you have severe wrinkles on your forehead and brow area.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title2\" class=\"hdg-3\">BLEPHAROPLASTY<\/h2>\n<p>Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) is a procedure that rejuvenates the upper face by addressing excess skin and fat in the upper and lower eyelids. The procedure is often separated into upper or lower blepharoplasty, though many patients undergo both at the same time. The surgeon surgically removes excess skin and fat and adjusts the muscle tissue to restore a more youthful appearance to the eyes. Blepharoplasty can restore full sightlines by removing excess upper eyelid skin in severe cases and can reduce fine lines and puffiness in the upper and lower eyelids.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-5\">CANDIDATES FOR BLEPHAROPLASTY<\/h3>\n<p>A candidate for blepharoplasty will have sagging, excess skin in the upper and\/or lower eyelids, usually accompanied by excess fat. Candidates may have prominent upper eyelid hooding that partially blocks their visual field. Bags beneath the eyes, typically caused by pockets of fat, may also be a symptom of aging experienced by blepharoplasty candidates. An old photograph of yourself will reveal whether the position of your eyebrows has changed over time; if it has not but you still have upper eyelid hooding, you may be a good candidate for blepharoplasty.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title3\" class=\"hdg-3\">CANDIDATES FOR A COMBINED BROW LIFT WITH BLEPHAROPLASTY<\/h2>\n<p>Some people identify as candidates for both brow lift surgery and eyelid surgery. When appropriate, it can be beneficial to undergo both procedures. Most often, candidates will get a brow lift with an upper blepharoplasty. For example, a candidate who has pronounced upper eyelid hooding due to a combination of excess upper eyelid skin and sagging brows will benefit most from undergoing both surgeries. Candidates for both procedures may have \u201ctired eyes\u201d as well as an angry appearance due to drooping eyebrows. If you have notably sagging brows, forehead wrinkles, sagging upper and\/or lower eyelids, and puffiness or bulging around your eyes, a combined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartbeautyguide.com\/procedures\/head-face\/brow-lift\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"brow lift - link opens in new tab\/window\">brow lift<\/a> with blepharoplasty can give you a more youthful and rested appearance.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title4\" class=\"hdg-3\">NON-SURGICAL BROW LIFT<\/h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways to non-surgically raise the eyebrow. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/botox\/\">BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic<\/a> can relax the muscles that pull the corner of the brow down. This loss of resting tone can lead to a nice elevation of the brow. Since it is an indirect effect, we cannot tell in advance who will get the best results from this treatment. Some patients look like they have had surgical brow lifts, and others only subtle changes. We can also use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/ultherapy\/\">Ultherapy\u00ae<\/a> to raise the brows in some patients.<br \/>\nTo find out if you are a good candidate for arguably the best brow lift or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blepharoplasty\/\">blepharoplasty NYC<\/a> has to offer, please come in for a personal evaluation.
