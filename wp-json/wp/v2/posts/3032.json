I have been quite busy, academically. I was lecturing in a course on Rhinoplasty in mid-September in St. Louis. The following week was the AAFPRS annual meeting followed by lecturing last week at the ENT (Ear Nose and Throat) annual meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The week before last\u00a0was the annual meeting of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS). Over 800 facial plastic surgeons from around the world were in attendance. I really enjoy going to this meeting for three reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>From attending and lecturing at 4 to 6 meetings and courses per year, I have made some great friends given our mutual interests and backgrounds.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li>I get to lecture to peers and young physicians on surgical techniques that I have mastered such as rhinoplasty and revision rhinoplasty.<\/li>\n<li>I learn from my peers. If I pick up at least two pointers at a meeting, I deem it a success. The most learning is done in the hallways between lectures, when I can get the real scoop on the latest techniques and lasers right from the innovators.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As for social events, the past president\u2019s dinner is always at a top restaurant. This is one group that no one can join, buy in or donate to attend. As a past president of the AAFPRS we are invited to a black tie dinner where we socialize and really discuss very little medicine. The next night was another black tie function, the founders club. This is always held at an unusual venue. This year it was in Fenway Park, a fun place to visit as a long time Yankee fan.<\/p>\n<p>I gave three lectures and seminars. I taught a course in revision rhinoplasty. I pointed out the most common things I see that brings patients in to see me for revision surgery and discussed what likely went wrong. The best treatment is doing things right in the first place and avoiding the need for revision surgery. I also included a description of how I restored these noses to a normal appearance and function.<\/p>\n<p>My second lecture was given with Wendy Lewis, who is a world authority on plastic surgery. She lectures to physicians around the world, advises potential patients about what and who is best for them to see. Wendy has written 11 books on cosmetic surgery. This seminar was on how to talk to patients and media in \u201cnon-medical\u201d speak. Too many doctors address patients and writers\/reporters in technical terms that leave heads spinning.<\/p>\n<p>My third lecture was at the ENT (otolaryngology) meeting the following week. I went back to Boston for the day to teach a course on the nasal valve with Dr. Maurice Khosh. We discussed this important area of nasal anatomy and physiology, and how it is important to respect as well as sometimes strengthen the nasal valves in rhinoplasty.<\/p>\n<p>Next week I will review what new educational pearls I picked up that I am going to use to improve my surgical techniques.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s been a few weeks since my last post.
