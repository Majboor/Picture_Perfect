Many appreciate, or even worship the sun. But, to paraphrase the saying, don\u2019t get too close, you may get burned.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve stayed out too long in the sun and end up with sunburn, try these home remedies that can help ease the pain until the skin heals on its own. Remember, though, that these remedies won\u2019t reverse the damage to the skin but only serve to ease the pain and discomfort as the skin heals naturally.\u00a0The \u201cBeauty Expert\u201d Donna Fay has some home remedies for those of you who do get burned.<\/p>\n<p>Adding a few tablespoons of baking soda to cool bath water creates a soothing remedy. Try to stay in for no longer than 15 or 20 minutes. Any longer and your skin will dry out more than it already has due to your time in the sun. When you get out of the tub air dry your skin instead of using a towel and don\u2019t wipe off the baking soda.<\/p>\n<p>Oatmeal can be used in the bath as well. Add to cool bath water\u00a0 (not cold, you\u2019ll send your body into shock) for another relief alternative. Don\u2019t use bath salts, oils, or bubble bath, but simply add 1\/2 to 1 cup of oatmeal and stir it into the bath.<\/p>\n<p>The Aloe vera plant can take the sting and redness out of a sunburn. Luckily, it\u2019s available at your local nursery or grocery store flower department. Slice open one f the leaves and apply this natural gel to the burn. Do this five to six times a day for several days.<\/p>\n<p>Soak a washcloth in cool water and apply it directly to the burned areas (do not use ice or ice pack) for several minutes. Do this multiple times throughout the day as needed. You can also add baking soda or oatmeal to the washcloth to help sooth the burn.<\/p>\n<p>For sunburn on harder to reach areas such as the back, slipping into a tub of chilly water is a good way to cool the burn and ease the pain. After the bath, pat you skin gently with a soft towel. If you\u2019re tempted to linger in the tub for a while, skip the bath and take a cool shower instead. Soaking too long can actually cause or aggravate dry skin, which can increase <a href=\"http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/skin-care\/moisturizing\/basics\/skin-dryness-and-itching.htm\">itching<\/a>\u00a0and peeling.<\/p>\n<p>The sun dries out the skin\u2019s surface and causes cells and blood vessels to leak, causing even greater moisture loss. To prevent drying, apply moisturizer immediately after your bath. Refrigerating the moisturizer before using adds a nice chill to help with soothing the skin and easing the pain.<\/p>\n<p>The plain old potato makes for a wonderful pain reliever. This tried and true method is known all over the world. Take two washed potatoes, cut them into small chunks, and place them in a blender or food processor. Blend or process until the potatoes liquefy. You can add water if the puree is too dry. Pat the burned areas with the pureed. Wait until the potatoes dry, and then take a cool shower. A less messy version is to apply the liquefied potatoes to clean gauze and place on the burn. Change the dressing every hour. Continue this process several times a day for a few days until you feel relief from the pain.<\/p>\n<p>Sensitive and hard-to-reach spots you\u2019ve neglected to protect with suntan lotion often feel the brunt of the burn. These spots are further irritated by tight elastic in bras and underwear. To ease chafing, cover the burned area with a dusting of cornstarch. Never use petroleum jelly or oils as these can, which can aggravate the burn by blocking pores. If the burn is blistering, however, don\u2019t apply anything.<\/p>\n<p>Whichever homemade remedy you use, keep in mind why you are using it: overexposure to the sun and the discomfort it caused. Next time, try and avoid the damage the sun can do to you. It\u2019s never good for the skin.<\/p>\n<p>So I was not going to share this story, but feel very strongly about sun exposure! How many of you know I haven\u2019t been in the sun since my mid 20s? Always wearing a hat and and block. Well, last week I had skin cancer cut out of my back. I\u00a0now have a hole in the middle of my back. Thank God it was treatable and got it in time. Of course it was probably from the days of baby oil and tanning beds. In addition do you think it can be hereditary? Yes it can, as a matter of fact my dear mother and myself both had it at the same time. She saw hers and I didn\u2019t see mine. She prompted me to go get checked. Thank God it was not on our faces because I would not be able to handle the possible deformity. Yes we all want to stay wrinkle free and beautiful for ever however we need to be alive for that\u00a0\u00a0If you would like to know where to go to get checked, I will refer you to a fantastic doctor.<\/p>\n<p>Please read below!<\/p>\n<p>Everyone is at some risk for melanoma, but increased risk depends on several factors: sun exposure, number of moles on the skin, skin type and family history (genetics).<\/p>\n<p>Heredity plays a major role in melanoma. About one in every 10 patients diagnosed with the disease has a family member with a history of melanoma. If your mother, father, siblings or children have had a melanoma, you are in a melanoma-prone family. Each person with a first-degree relative diagnosed with melanoma has a 50 percent greater chance of developing the disease than people who do not have a family history of the disease.<\/p>\n<p>Stay healthy and stay beautiful!<\/p>\n<p>Love Donna xoxo<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This summer, thoughts turn to the sun.
