They have been studying the body in class and had a visit by another parent, an internal medicine specialist who demonstrated how she examines people using devices such as stethoscope and blood pressure cuff. My wife and the teacher suggested I come in and talk about surgery. I was\u00a0incredibly nervous, what can I talk to 16 4-5 year olds about?<\/p>\n<p>I started the morning by wearing surgical scrubs and my cleanest sneakers. I bestowed each child with a medical degree for the day; as they introduced themselves I had them call themselves doctor. Dr. X xxx, Dr. Yyyy, Dr.\u00a0Zzzz , etc. We discussed that there are a number of different kinds of doctors such as pediatricians, medical doctors, dentists and of course, surgeons. Sometimes surgery is necessary when medicine doesn\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<p>We talked about how clean an operating room is. Each child put on (or was helped), surgical booties, hats and masks. We then discussed special hand washing; 5 times for each side of the hands then arms. This was simulated by each one with a dry scrub brush followed by a surgical towel. Lastly, each put on blue gloves.<\/p>\n<p>My daughter chose a doll as a patient. We discussed how a mask is used by a doctor called an anesthesiologist, whose very important job it is to make sure that the patients are asleep and don\u2019t feel anything. I taped on an IV then used a mask to \u201cput the patient to sleep.\u201d\u00a0 Following, I demonstrated some surgical instruments and then sew up patients.<\/p>\n<p>We finished with discussing the body. The heart pumps blood to the body. The brain helps us think, talk, see, hear and move. Bones support the body. I brought a gold painted simulated skull. The finale was when I opened the top and it was filled with candy.<\/p>\n<p>Whew! This was more nerve wracking than surgery. It went extremely well and I cannot describe how wonderful I felt after. I made my daughter so proud. I wouldn\u2019t trade the chance to share with my daughters and their friends for anything.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A visit to my daughter\u2019s class to discuss surgery and surgeons This week I had&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":905,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[235],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Future Surgeons With a Facial Plastic Surgeon in New York &bull;
