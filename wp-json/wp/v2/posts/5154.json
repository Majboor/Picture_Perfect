While it\u2019s not possible to stop the aging process, aesthetic medicine has developed strategic anti-aging treatments that can help slow the process and allow us to feel and look like the best versions of ourselves for longer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a premier provider of anti-aging treatments in NYC. No matter what your aesthetic goals are, there is a treatment that can help you meet them. Our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/plastic-surgeons-in-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aesthetic experts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are highly trained and work with each patient to develop a personalized treatment plan based on their individual goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of our anti-aging treatments are 100% customizable for each patient. Restorative aesthetic medicine isn\u2019t really about <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">changing<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the way you look, but restoring your appearance by partnering with your body\u2019s natural processes. It\u2019s about helping you look more like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does our skin age?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding how anti-aging treatments work requires understanding how the skin ages. Our skin gets its shape and structure from two proteins: collagen and elastin. <\/span><b>As we age, our body slows down its production of these proteins and eventually stops producing them altogether. This leads to loss of volume, sagging, wrinkles, slowed healing\u2014which all contribute to our skin looking worn and developing wrinkles.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-aging treatments focus on boosting our body\u2019s production of collagen and elastin, usually through a type of controlled injury. Your body\u2019s natural healing process inherently creates more collagen and elastin, which leads to firmer, smoother skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-aging treatments in NYC\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many options for anti-aging treatments that are designed to target specific parts of the aging process. Most of these treatments can be used to treat multiple conditions, or used in combination with each other to provide even more enhanced results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-aging treatments for wrinkles<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrinkles are typically the first thing people picture when they think about getting older. Most of our aesthetic treatments will help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but some are more effective than others.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Botox<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/botox-in-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Botox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a household name for a reason, it\u2019s one of the most effective ways to reduce wrinkles on the market and has been for decades. Our highly trained aesthetic providers can strategically inject Botox to reduce wrinkles. We also offer similar products such as Dysport, Xeomin,, Juveau and Daxxify.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a neurotoxin, Botox works by relaxing the facial muscles that lead to wrinkles around the eyes and mouth. Because it\u2019s injected into the muscle, Botox treats current wrinkles and slows the formation of new wrinkles. Fillers like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/frequent-filler-miles-juvederm-and-botox-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juvederm and Botox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work well together to provide more comprehensive facial rejuvenation. Of course we use many other fillers as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also offer other neurotoxins like Juveau, Dysport, and Xeomin. These treatments are great because they are quick and don\u2019t require any downtime after.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultherapy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through ultrasound waves, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/ultherapy-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultherapy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> targets the skin\u2019s deeper layers to stimulate collagen growth. This treatment tightens skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles without the need for downtime or extensive recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultherapy is the first FDA treatment approved to reduce wrinkles and lines on the face. It actually treats the same layer of tissue as a surgical <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system), which means it can provide similar results to a facelift or brow lift with significantly less downtime and recovery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_846\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-846 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Botox-5563-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"patient receiving consultation for anti-aging treatments at Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Botox-5563-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Botox-5563-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Botox-5563-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Botox-5563-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Pearlman-Aesthetic-Surgery-Botox-5563.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-aging treatments for volume loss<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of your sagging skin is caused by a loss of volume in your skin cells and also as our balance of fat changes in different areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillers\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as volume loss treatments go, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facial-fillers-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facial fillers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a go-to treatment for a lot of patients, with good reason! Fillers provide immediate, long-lasting results with a treatment that only takes about 30 minutes and doesn&#8217;t require any downtime!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our facial filler specialists can safely inject fillers in the lips, under the eyes, and in the cheeks to replace volume lost. We offer multiple brands and types of fillers, including Voluma, Restylane, RHA,\u00a0 Radiesse and <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/sculptra-new-york-city\/\">Sculptra<\/a>, so our experts can provide a customized filler plan to address your unique results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microneedling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For sagging skin, volume loss, or scarring\u00a0 that is caused by decreased collagen, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/microneedling-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microneedling<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/rf-microneedling-in-nyc\/\">RF microneedling<\/a> treatments can restore the skin\u2019s natural structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through controlled injury using micro-sized needles, microneedling stimulates your body\u2019s healing response, which stimulates collagen production. When we use radio frequency (RF) energy as part of the microneedling process, it further stimulates the layers of your skin to tighten and tone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microneedling can be used in conjunction with fillers to further correct volume loss. Adding RF to microneedling can also enhance results and shorten healing time so you can get back to work faster.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-aging treatments for skin texture and age spots<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we get older, the cell turnover in our skin slows down and can lead to a buildup of dead skin cells and rough skin texture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BBL HERO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/ipl-photofacial-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IPL photofacial<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, BBL HERO is a state-of-the-art broadband light system that uses the power of light to improve pigment, redness, and overall skin quality with no downtime. The intense pulsed light gently heats your skin to encourage your body\u2019s natural healing process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BBL device uses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sciton.com\/bbl-hero-by-sciton\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9 different filters<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> designed to treat dozens of different skin conditions and spot size adapters to change the size of the treatment area to adjust for different curves and parts of the face. These unique aspects make the treatment completely customizable to your individual skin concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CO2<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/co2-laser-resurfacing-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laser skin resurfacing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one the most aggressive treatments you can do for full face skin rejuvenation. It is one of the most effective anti-aging treatments in NYC. At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we use a fractionated CO2 laser. We can fully adjust the wavelength, depth of penetration, and spacing of the penetration points to account for your skin type and desired results. The fractionated laser spares normal skin in between laser spots for faster healing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laser skin rejuvenation can require up to a week of recovery after your treatment or even more if you want an aggressive treatment (and even better results). The laser removes the top most layer of your skin, which encourages new cell growth while removing damaged skin. The stronger your treatment, the longer your recovery. We like to say, the worse you look after laser resurfacing and the longer you look bad, the better the result.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I decide between anti-aging treatments in NYC?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/consultation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scheduling a consultation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with an expert provider is the best way to determine which anti-aging treatments will help you achieve your aesthetic goals.
