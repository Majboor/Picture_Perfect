Let\u2019s face it. Most of us shudder at the thought of \u201cgetting\u00a0old\u201d\u00a0\u2013 whether it\u2019s facing the fact that our energy level is not what it used to be, or the fact that those dreaded wrinkles are constantly a literal walking advertisement of our age. Most of us are on a mission to preserve the youth we once took for granted. I mean really, who ever thought we would become \u201cthat old person\u201d? With advancements in research and technology, we now have available to us many tools to fight Father Time, that dastardly Muther!\u00a0From hormone replacement therapy, to using plasma rich protein to rejuvenate the skin, it seems the growing possibilities are endless.<\/p>\n<p>That being said\u2026.let\u2019s talk some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blog\/botox\/\">BOTOX<\/a>\u2026the (safe) gateway drug to youthfulness.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that got your attention.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, who likes wrinkles? I realize that wrinkles are actually our character lines and tell a story \u2013 but why not use them to be a mystery novel? When people hear the word Botox, reactions vary. Many will say they can\u2019t live without it, others\u2026not so much, I mean who wants to look like Keith Richards, then again, who wants to look stone-faced? What\u2019s the happy medium?\u00a0One of the toughest parts of my job as a nurse injector is properly educating our patients and instilling the confidence to try something new, especially if a consult happens to occur around the same time as the Grammy or Academy awards!\u00a0To have the confidence to try something new that will still look like YOU\u2026a refreshed, smoother version and natural-looking is key.<\/p>\n<p>I started this little blog with Botox, as it has been the gold standard in wrinkle releasers (ok neuromodulators but who uses that word) since 2002 when it first became FDA approved for the use on those Angry\u00a011 lines between the eyes. Since then, we have come a long way, baby. Not only have we expanded the areas practitioners are able to treat but, there has been some new competition on the market \u2013 same game, different name! Although newer products such as Dysport and Xeomin vary in their chemical properties, the mechanism of action is the basically the same. So we know we have options with product, but how many of you really knew that we now have multiple options on what these \u201crefreshers\u201d can do for us?<\/p>\n<p>I decided to incorporate a new approach to non-surgical cosmetic procedures in our practice. I guess if I had to come up with a name for it I could call it Boutique Botox. The experience I give our patients is unique and exciting. We only have one face. I like to think that, similar to purchasing a big ticket item from Best Buy, people do their homework and educate themselves and research all of the options available. It all begins with the consultation process. So many times my patients have told me that they have never had someone explain to them\u00a0in depth the \u201cwhy behind the how\u201d when it comes to any cosmetic injection. I have to say this amazes me. Seriously, if you do not know HOW the product works and WHY it is being injected where it is\u2026how could you possibly understand what the outcome will be- Seriously folks there is more out there than just getting rid of a line! I often wonder, did you really just go in somewhere allow them to stick needles in your face and just go home hoping you would wake up with no wrinkles! If this is the case, please do not do it again.<\/p>\n<p>You are in the driver\u2019s seat of you anti-aging process\u2013Let me be your trusted co-pilot!<\/p>\n<p>Wrinkle reducers should come with a menu. It\u2019s all about the muscles. To make it short and sweet, we have two\u00a0basic muscle functions in the face, depressors (help make the tired mean face, and elevators (our happy approachable face). It is the happy\u00a0yin\/yang\u00a0balance\u00a0of manipulating these muscles that helps us achieve our aesthetic goals.\u00a0Naturally.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BOUTIQUE BOTOX OK!
