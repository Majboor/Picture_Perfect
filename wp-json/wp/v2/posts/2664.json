Medical tourism is the practice of traveling to another locale to undergo plastic surgery procedures. The reason for medical tourism gaining a foothold outside of the US, often in under-developed countries, is largely due to the fact that medical care in such areas is much more affordable. Coupled with a tropical climate and pristine white sandy beaches, people flock to these destinations for combination surgery-vacation jaunts. However, medical tourism may have a downside.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of care may be lower, but many times it comes at the expense of the level of care received. Facility accreditation can be iffy at best, leaving you open to much higher risk than in a hospital or clinic in the United States. Plus if you have a complication after surgery, there is little to no recourse or chance to follow up if you travelled outside the US for surgery.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you have your heart set on the experience of a destination cosmetic surgery coupled with a recuperative vacation, come see us in The Big Apple. New York is an obvious choice when considering contenders for the medical tourism crown. Not only should all Americans visit New York City at least once in their lifetimes, visiting a Park Avenue facial plastic surgeon can give you the experience of a lifetime\u2026the beginning of the rest of your life, if you will. You won\u2019t find that in Barbados!<\/p>\n<p>Our office is located in Manhattan on the famous Park Avenue, just two blocks away from Central Park, a short 16-minute walk to Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, and a short 7 minute drive to the MET \u2013 Metropolitan Museum of Art.<\/p>\n<p>After your procedure, New York City has countless luxurious and elegant five star accommodations for you to relax and recuperate in. In fact, Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery has special arrangements with a number of high quality New York Hotels. The Kimberly is a beautiful boutique hotel with mostly suites in the heart of mid-town, yet price sensitive. For real luxury we have affiliations with the Pierre, Lowell, and Carlyle hotels. Another option is the Affinia Gardens, a hotel specializing in post-surgery care. When some time has passed and you\u2019re feeling up to it, the countless delights of New York City are yours to discover. Try out your new face on a nice stroll through Central Park to the Central Park Zoo, or during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art. Indulge yourself in a trip up to the top of Empire State Building, or a little retail therapy in one of many New York City boutiques.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s really no need to take the risk of leaving the good old USA for a cosmetic surgery vacation. It\u2019s safer to do it right here at home. So pack your bags and prepare for an adventure in the city that never sleeps.
