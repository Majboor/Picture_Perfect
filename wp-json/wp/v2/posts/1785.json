But are you ready to undergo this procedure? Here are some ways to know whether you\u2019re ready to change your life with facial rejuvenation surgery.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title1\" class=\"hdg-3\">PHYSICAL SIGNS THAT YOU\u2019RE READY FOR A FACELIFT<\/h2>\n<p>A facelift corrects sagging tissues in the lower face and neck. If you have jowls, significant lower face wrinkles, and poor jawline definition, you could be ready for a facelift. A good test is to set your hands along the sides of your jaw and pull gently toward your ears. If the results seem desirable, you could be a good candidate for this surgery. Other physical signs that you\u2019re ready for a facelift include sagging neck tissues and muscle banding on the neck.<br \/>\nIn addition, you should be in good physical and mental health. A facelift is a major surgery, and if you have notable health issues, you are not ready for major surgery. Once your health is under control and your doctor has given approval, you could be ready for facelift surgery.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title2\" class=\"hdg-3\">EMOTIONAL SIGNS THAT YOU\u2019RE READY FOR A FACELIFT<\/h2>\n<p>You may also be ready for a facelift if you have certain emotional indicators. Candidates with noticeable signs of aging should desire a change because they are bothered by their wrinkles and sagging skin. If you look in the mirror and feel discouraged because your appearance does not reflect the youthful and confident person you feel you are, then you may be ready for a facelift. If you are ever dissatisfied that your aged appearance makes you look tired, angry, or sad when you do not feel so, it could be a good time to undergo this procedure. Most importantly, you should be self-motivated. If you are receiving outside pressure to get a facelift, it may be better to hold off until you want it for yourself. On the other hand, if you know you want the procedure, you should feel free to pursue your desires.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title3\" class=\"hdg-3\">THE RIGHT TIME FOR A FACELIFT<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2534\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignright\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2534\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Facelift-Dr.-Pearlman-Before-and-After-photos-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"189\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Timing is one of the most critical aspects of preparing for a facelift. Most facelift patients are between the ages of 40 and 60. Patients who get a facelift before age 50 may see the best results because they tend to have more youthful skin elasticity. Additionally, because the tissues of your face will be more sensitive to the sun during recovery, it may be best to get a facelift in the fall or winter. Winter is also opportune because sun exposure is more minimal and hats and scarves are more appropriate accessories. These factors will help protect your skin and reduce scarring.<br \/>\nLastly, you will not be ready for a facelift until you can schedule your time and life around the recovery. Patients must be prepared to take at least 10 to 14 days off of work for their surgery and recovery. Dr. Pearlman also recommends scheduling your facelift at least two to three months or more before an important function, such as your daughter\u2019s wedding. This surgery can change your life, so it is best to make sure that you are ready for it and that you will be able to enjoy the results.<br \/>\n<i>Other factors such as finances can also determine whether you are ready for a facelift. If you feel that now may be a good time to consider this procedure, schedule your consultation with Dr. Steven J. Pearlman. Dr. Pearlman is dual board certified in facial plastic surgery and can help you determine whether you are a good facelift candidate and whether you are prepared for this surgery.
