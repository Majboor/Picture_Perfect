Expertise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your nose is one of the most prominent features on your face, you don\u2019t want to trust your nose job to just any surgeon. \u201cNose job\u201d makes it sound like a casual affair, and while rhinoplasties are one of the most common procedures, it\u2019s not a simple surgery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking for a surgeon, you want someone who specializes in rhinoplasties, who devotes most of their practice to it. The nose isn\u2019t just a body part, it\u2019s a sensory organ that affects a large part of how we experience our lives. It\u2019s important that you find a surgeon that is at the very least board certified by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abfprs.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. StevenJ.

Types of Procedures<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/nose-plastic-surgery-in-nyc\/\">nose plastic surgery<\/a>, there isn\u2019t a one size fits all approach. A rhinoplasty surgeon that offers more specific types of rhinoplasties is a good sign. There have been plenty of advancements in rhinoplasty technique, and you want a surgeon who can provide you with the right rhinoplasty treatment for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"hdg-6\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Types of Rhinoplasties (click on each subject title for links to more in depth information)<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/preservation-rhinoplasty-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preservation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: For reducing a nasal hump but maintaining the continuity of your in-born natural bridge.

Make sure they have consistent angels and lighting, and in general that they don\u2019t seem edited. Ask to see photos during your consultation; you can ask your surgeon to elaborate on the process used for the patient, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Computer Imaging<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be very hard to envision the results of your potential nose job. The best rhinoplasty surgeons provide multiple methods that help you better understand your potential results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery we use both Mirror 2D and Vectra 3D imaging to help our patients really envision what their results will look like. The use of this technology is vital to understanding not only the potential changes and improvements to the nose itself, but also promotes a dialogue between patient and doctor to visualize your new nose and how it appears with the rest of your facial features.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"hdg-5\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Consultation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many types of rhinoplasties and factors that can influence your surgery, it\u2019s important to know you can get your questions answered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want an expert surgeon, but you also want a surgeon that you can have a good relationship with. Plastic surgery, particularly for the face, is a really intimate experience, and not the kind of experience you want to schedule on a whim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consultation is one of the most significant parts of the plastic surgery process because it sets the tone for your relationship with your surgeon. This is the time when you and your surgeon work together to come to a mutual understanding of the expectations for your rhinoplasty procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best rhinoplasty surgeon will listen to your concerns as well as provide expert guidance on how to best achieve your desired goal: achieve facial harmony without compromising the function of your nose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also offer each and every patient the opportunity to return for a second (and sometimes third) visit to discuss any questions or apprehension they may have about getting rhinoplasty. Some patients might even want to ask about information they received at a consultation elsewhere. We don\u2019t charge for these visits, they are covered with the initial consultation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman discusses rhinoplasty in this video:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IXOOHyB3-SA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions to Ask in Your Rhinoplasty Consultation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t want to settle for just any rhinoplasty near you, that\u2019s why taking the most advantage of your consultation is crucial to making your decision. During the consultation is when you should feel free to ask any and every question you need to feel confident that your surgeon is going to serve you well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, you\u2019ll want to ask questions that pertain to what we\u2019ve mentioned here: confirm your surgeon is board certified, that they use computer imaging techniques, and can provide quality before and after photos.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong><span class=\"hdg-6\">More questions to ask:<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is your experience with performing rhinoplasty surgeries?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does rhinoplasty comprise the majority of the surgeries your surgeon performs?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is your policy on revisions if I don\u2019t like my results?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long is the expected recovery timeline?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will you support me in my recovery?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When can I expect to see final results?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which technique do you plan to use in my rhinoplasty?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you combine other plastic surgery procedures with my rhinoplasty?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to prepare for a rhinoplasty surgery<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you\u2019ve found the best rhinoplasty surgeon and you\u2019ve scheduled your rhinoplasty near you in NYC.
