Try These Memory-Boosting Foods!"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"main-entry clearfix\">\n<div class=\"entry-content single-entry-content\">\n<p>The morning routine and rush out the door is one most of us can be familiar with. Feed the kids, pack lunches, make sure the homework is in the backpacks\u2026 You\u2019re ready to go, except you had had your keys just a few minutes ago, and now you can\u2019t find them anywhere; you can\u2019t find your sunglasses (you forgot they\u2019re on your head and it takes 10 minutes of searching before you realize it) and you realize your socks don\u2019t match as soon as you get into the car.<\/p>\n<p>What a way to start the day.<\/p>\n<p>We talk a lot about aging and reversing the signs of aging. Usually, our focus is on skin. Today, however, we\u2019d like to look at another symptom specific to aging: memory loss.<\/p>\n<p>Memory loss is one of the first things people notice about aging. In addition to age, stress can cause lack of concentration and inability to remember details. Fortunately, memory is something that can be easily improved just by adding some essential nutrients to your diet.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Leave your keys in the fridge and the milk in the pantry? Eat more fish!<\/h2>\n<p>Fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which has long been known to improve brain function. Cold-water fish, such as salmon, halibut, herring, and tuna are all excellent sources of omega-3. These fatty acids improve the cell membrane, protecting it from damage and degradation.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Forget whose turn it was to pick up the kids\u2026again? Leafy greens can help.<\/h2>\n<p>Leafy green vegetables contain many essential nutrients. Among these are antioxidants, which protect the brain from damage and keep the cells healthy. Deep green vegetables also contain folic acid. Studies have shown that folic acid can protect memory and even reverse the effects of aging. Good examples include spinach, kale, and Swiss chard.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Milk\u2019s not just for kids.<\/h2>\n<p>Dairy products are rich in tyrosine proteins, which support the health of neurotransmitters in the brain. These neurotransmitters are what carry signals around in the brain. They can become damaged, weak, or non-functioning, resulting in memory loss. Eat low-fat dairy products such as cottage cheese, yogurt and milk.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">A toast to your memory!<\/h2>\n<p>Whole grains contain various vitamins and minerals to improve memory. Foods that are made with whole grains contain vitamins A, B, C, and E, as well as magnesium. These nutrients improve the structure and function of the brain. In addition, whole grains provide the body with a good source of complex carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are turned to glucose, which is used to fuel the brain.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Don\u2019t be an egg-head.<\/h2>\n<p>Eggs are excellent sources of choline and vitamin B, both of which are building blocks for the brain. Lecithin, an essential fatty acid, is also found in eggs.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Iron out the wrinkles in your diet.<\/h2>\n<p>Meats, such as chicken and beef, are rich in iron. A deficiency in iron can cause poor concentration and slow thinking processes. Iron improves memory by providing the brain with the oxygen it needs to function optimally.<\/p>\n<p>Before you forget what you\u2019ve read here, print this out or write it down and put it on your fridge for future reference. Eventually, your memory will improve and you\u2019ll wonder how you ever lived without all the delicious and nutritious fish, leafy greens, milk, who grains, eggs and meat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Copyright 2012.
