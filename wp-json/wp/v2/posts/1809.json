It&#8217;s the first thing people see when they look at you, and it&#8217;s how you most often express who you are.

Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery is led by world-renowned dual-board-certified facial surgeon <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/facial-plastic-surgeon-new-york-city\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Depending on your needs for facial rejuvenation, one of the below facelift procedures could help you achieve a more youthful and rested appearance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we age in the face?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/collagen\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collagen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is our body\u2019s favorite protein. It keeps our skin tight, firm, and smooth. You can think of collagen as the support structure for your skin! As we age, we stop producing as much collagen, which results in signs of aging like wrinkles, sagging skin, and hollowness in areas like the cheeks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without the framework needed to keep our skin tight and smooth over our facial structure, gravity pulls the skin downward and can make you look angry, tired, or worn out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This results in hollow areas around the cheeks and under the eyes, fine lines and wrinkles, and jowls (sagging skin around the neck and under the chin). Many people decide that a facelift is the best option to feel and look like themselves again. So, let\u2019s explore the options we offer at Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery for your facelift in NYC.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. THE MINI-FACELIFT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most popular types of facelifts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/best-facelift-in-NYC\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mini-facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> targets aging in the lower face. This procedure is not designed to address heavy jowls or severe signs of facial aging, but it can create a more uplifted, smoother facial contour.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mini-facelift treats:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimal sagging in the lower face<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early jowls<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excess skin in the neck<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best candidates for this procedure are younger patients with the aforementioned characteristics of aging who desire a more youthful and well-defined lower face and neck. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mini-facelift can be used as a preventative measure to ensure you continue to age with grace and beauty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch Dr. Pearlman discuss his facelift method before <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/consultation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scheduling a consultation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YkIwmOH-WVE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-2 hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. THE MID-FACELIFT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mid-facelift targets cheek sagging to rejuvenate the midface region. This procedure elevates the tissues of the cheeks to eliminate sagging and reduce deep creases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best for patients who do not have jowls or excess skin sagging in the neck, the mid-facelift can enhance facial definition, create more attractive cheek contours, eliminate nasolabial folds, and even improve the lower eyelids. It can also be incorporated with other facial procedures if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. THE DEEP PLANE FACELIFT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/deep-plane-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deep plane facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> targets severe cheek and neck aging. This procedure lifts the muscle tissue and skin to correct heavy cheeks, neck sagging, and skin laxity. Long recognized for its ability to produce the most natural-looking and longest-lasting facelift results, the deep plane facelift can yield a refined and rejuvenated appearance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a deep plane facelift, Dr. Pearlman is also able to reposition the \u201capples\u201d of the cheeks from where they may have fallen lower on the face back to atop the cheekbones. This will completely rejuvenate the appearance of the face.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research has shown that patients <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-2241642\/How-facelift-look-years-Leading-surgeon-answers-question-woman-asks.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">look at least five years younger after a deep plane facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and still look better five and a half years after their surgery than they did before.

MyEllevate<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not your typical neck lift. In fact, it boasts results (reduction in double chin or \u201cturkey neck\u201d) that might rival a mini-neck lift with very tiny incisions and minimal downtime! MyEllevate is a non-surgical procedure that can be perfectly paired with other facial rejuvenation procedures such as FaceTite and neck liposuction.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0MyEllevate uses a suture support system with a few tiny incisions to lift and define the neck. You\u2019ll feel and look years younger in less than an hour.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.

Using ultrasound energy, Ultherapy\u00ae stimulates the foundational tissues and support layers of the skin to help tighten early jowls and early skin laxity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultherapy treats:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin laxity in the face and neck<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crepiness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fine lines and wrinkles<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This procedure is best for younger patients, those who would like to preempt the need for surgery, patients who may not be ready for surgery, or patients who wish to prolong the effects of a previous facelift procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4878\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 577px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4878\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/2022-01-11-045028-1-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/2022-01-11-045028-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/2022-01-11-045028-1-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/2022-01-11-045028-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/2022-01-11-045028-1.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Pearlman may also incorporate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facial-fillers-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dermal fillers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/non-surgical-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-surgical facelift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to restore lost volume and fill in hollow recesses caused by the loss of collagen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. FaceTite<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/facetite-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FaceTite<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the perfect solution for those patients who would like to replicate the results of a mini-facelift without a long recovery period or going under general anesthesia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This non-surgical procedure uses radio frequency energy to encourage the natural production of collagen in your skin. Your expert technician uses the device to gently heat the layers of your skin, which signal to the body to begin its natural healing process. This process encourages cell regeneration and collagen production and significantly improves facial skin laxity!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The treatment typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours. You\u2019ll undergo the procedure under local anesthetic, so you\u2019ll be entirely comfortable. During the treatment, you can chat with your provider, listen to music, or just lay back and relax. There is very little downtime associated with FaceTite, so you\u2019ll be able to return to your normal routine quite quickly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paired procedures<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neck liposuction<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/chin-liposuction-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neck liposuction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> targets excess fat in the neck, chin, and even the jowls. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This minimally invasive procedure utilizes tiny tubes called cannulas, which gently suction out any excess, undesired fat under the chin and on the neck. Neck liposuction can cure that pesky double chin and give you a more defined, contoured jawline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This procedure is a fantastic procedure to combine with facelift surgery to eliminate surplus fat that accumulates beneath the chin. This procedure may be appropriate for individuals who would like to eliminate a double chin and flatten prominent jowls. The best candidates have minimal laxity of the neck skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facelift for men<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men\u2019s facial anatomy is different from women\u2019s, and therefore the surgical procedure will look different as well. While the technique and expertise of Dr. Pearlman doesn\u2019t change, he will accommodate the necessary adjustments for a confident, chiseled, masculine appearance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/male-facelift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facelift for men<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can improve:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jowls<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sagging skin around the cheeks, neck, and under the chin<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facial volume loss<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasolabial folds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neck bands<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marionette lines<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4420\" class=\"thumbnail wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 700px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4420\" src=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/20892-2-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/20892-2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/20892-2-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/20892-2-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mdface.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/20892-2-1.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men, you deserve to feel confident and attractive, and Dr. Pearlman has 30+ years of experience tailoring the facelift to male features. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/consultation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us today<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to schedule a consultation and get a more youthful-looking appearance!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"hdg-3\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THE SILHOUETTE INSTALIFT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/silhouette-instalift\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silhouette InstaLift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses dissolvable sutures and cones to anchor the cheeks and re-suspend sagging facial structures such as jowls, cheeks, nasolabial folds, and excess neck skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Silhouette InstaLift procedure mitigates many signs of aging with very little downtime, ultimately encouraging the body\u2019s natural process of producing collagen around the threads. The procedure is typically used around the cheeks, brows, jawline, and neck in order to restore structure and youthful orientation to the face.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patients often wish to correct sagging facial tissue, such as jowls along the jawline, mild drooping skin under the chin (\u201cturkey neck\u201d), descending cheeks, and deep creases from the outer nostrils to the corners of the mouth (nasolabial folds).<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The InstaLift can tackle these signs of aging with very little downtime. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best candidates for this procedure are younger patients who aren\u2019t quite ready for a full surgical facelift.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of facelifts | Surgical vs. non-surgical<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-surgical alternatives to facelifts are not a 1:1 replacement.

However, non-surgical alternatives like FaceTite and Ultherapy are fantastic options for those who aren\u2019t able to invest in the downtime required of a surgical procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-surgical options can also \u201ckick the can down the road,\u201d and we encourage you to use them as preventative measures before a facelift and maintenance procedures after you\u2019ve undergone one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of facelifts | How it works<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a closer look at the process for the different types of facelifts we offer at Pearlman Aesthetic Surgery!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We begin each and every one of our surgical and non-surgical procedures with an in-depth<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/consultation\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consultation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, during which we will discuss your unique concerns, desired results, and lifestyle factors such as age, general health, and capacity for downtime.

For surgical facelifts, we will put you under general anesthesia. Typically, a facelift procedure can take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours depending on which type we perform and if you\u2019ve chosen to incorporate any complementary procedures, like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mdface.com\/treatments\/brow-lift-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lift<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the procedure, Dr. Pearlman will strategically make small incisions near the hair line.The exact placement of these incisions depends on which of the types of facelifts you\u2019re getting. If you\u2019re undergoing a male facelift, the incision placement will likely be different, as men tend to have different hair lines than women.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once he\u2019s made these incisions, he\u2019ll pull back and tighten the face of the skin, trim any excess skin, and make any necessary adjustments to completely rejuvenate your face! Finally, he\u2019ll close the incisions with a meticulous technique and you&#8217;ll be on your way to looking years younger.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recovery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recovery period depends on which of the 6 types of facelifts you have. Immediately following your surgical procedure you\u2019ll experience slight bruising, swelling, and soreness. Unless you receive a mini-facelift, you\u2019ll need to stay overnight at the surgical facility in order for us to monitor you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a mini-lift, patients can often return to work or their normal routine in about a week and a half.

If you\u2019ve noticed signs of aging that you\u2019d like to correct, then you\u2019re likely a suitable candidate for a facelift!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will my facelift results look natural?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a dual-board-certified facial plastic surgeon, Dr. Pearlman is uniquely qualified to guarantee natural, gorgeous facelift results. Prior to your procedure, we spend time studying your unique facial features and then customizing a treatment plan to enhance those features. Results are subtle but absolutely breathtaking, without creating a \u201cplastic\u201d look.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long do facelift results last?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surgical facelift results are permanent, but that doesn\u2019t mean the natural aging process will halt. You\u2019ll continue aging like everyone else, but you\u2019ll feel like you stepped back in time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much does a facelift in NYC cost?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of a facelift in NYC varies greatly from patient to patient, depending upon multiple factors such as the technique Dr. Pearlman chooses to use, your unique facial anatomy, and your desired results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, a facelift will range anywhere from $15,000 to $35,000. Dr. Pearlman will determine your personal facelift quote after your initial consultation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will there be any scarring from the surgical facelift procedure?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although scarring is always a possibility for any surgical procedure, Dr. Pearlman has over 30 years of experience. He employs a meticulous closure technique that makes scarring virtually invisible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, any scarring from a surgical facelift procedure is typically well-hidden by the hairline and the natural contours of the face.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule your facelift consultation today.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is the time to turn back the clock and feel better than you have in years.
