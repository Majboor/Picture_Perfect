Here are 5 of the most common culprits.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Sun Exposure<\/h2>\n<p>The sun is the biggest cause of skin damage. The UV rays of the sun break down collagen and elastin, which keeps your skin looking plump and smooth. They also affect the melanocytes, which can change your skin\u2019s pigmentation. Then there are the aging effects; continuous and excessive sun exposure eventually shows on your skin as wrinkles, age spots, and possibly skin cancer.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid skin damage that can be caused by the sun, our Beauty Expert Donna advises staying out of the sun during the middle of the day when the sun\u2019s rays are strongest, wearing protective clothing such as a hat, and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both types of harmful UV rays, UVA and UVB. Try a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Don\u2019t forget to reapply every two hours for the maximum amount of protection.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Free radicals<\/h2>\n<p>One of the ways the sun damages your skin is through the production of harmful substances called free radicals. These are unstable oxygen molecules with a single electron. Doctors think that UV light from the sun can lead to damaged DNA and skin damage. Free radicals may even play a role in the development of skin cancer. Some skin care products contain antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, which help lessen the aging effects of free radicals. Eating plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, which contain antioxidants, is also good for healthy skin.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Cigarettes<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, the skin of a smoker isn\u2019t as healthy and doesn\u2019t heal as well as someone who doesn\u2019t smoke. A smoker\u2019s skin also has a tendency to wrinkle easily. This is because smoking cigarettes causes all of your blood vessels to constrict, including the vessels that feed nutrients to the outer layers of your skin. When you smoke, your skin gets less of the oxygen and nutrients it needs to stay healthy, and that leads to wrinkles. Smoking also causes the elastic fibers in the skin to thicken which prevents your skin from snapping back into shape, and can also cause sagging.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Irritants<\/h2>\n<p>The chemicals found in cleaning products and laundry detergent can cause red, irritated skin, and allergies in some. These chemicals may cause contact dermatitis, which is scaling, irritation, and sometimes even a chemical burn. People with more sensitive skin can experience more irritation than others. The easiest way to protect your skin from irritants is to avoid contact. This can be done by wearing gloves when you clean or do dishes or by switching to less irritating products.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"hdg-3\">Smiles and frowns<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a common truth that as we age, our skin loses its elasticity and doesn\u2019t snap back into place after you make facial expressions the way it did when you were younger. As a result, our skin will start to show wrinkles even when we\u2019re not laughing or frowning. We\u2019re not saying to stop living life or to stop showing expressions on your face, that\u2019s impossible, but you can try to combat aging effects by preventing skin damage from the sun by using sunscreen. Also, a host of procedures are available to reduce wrinkles, including microdermabrasion, chemical peels, laser resurfacing, and injectable fillers such as collagen.<\/p>\n<p>Our resident Beauty Expert Donna Fay can answer any questions or concerns you may have about your skin, as well as help build a proper skincare routine. \u00a0You can do so\u00a0by clicking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdface.com\/blog\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"here - link opens in new tab\/window\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a lot of things out there that can cause damage to our skin.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2593,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[241],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 Common Culprits That Damage Our Skin &bull;
