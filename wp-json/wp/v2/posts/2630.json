The study will be published in the upcoming\u00a0Journal of Psychiatric Research. The men behind the study are Eric Finzi, a cosmetic dermatologist, and Norman Rosenthal, a professor of psychiatry at Georgetown Medical School. Their study involved\u00a0a group of 74 patients with\u00a0major depression\u00a0who received either Botox injections or a placebo, in the form of saline injections, to the forehead. The goal was to \u201cfreeze\u201d the muscles whose\u00a0contraction\u00a0makes it possible to frown.<\/p>\n<p>About six weeks after the treatments Finzi and Rosenthal found that 52% of the patients who received Botox treatments saw\u00a0relief from depression, while only 15% of the patients who received the saline placebo felt relief. Other studies have been held over the past several years, and they too have found similar effects of Botox on a person\u2019s mood. Michael Lewis at Cardiff University found in his own study\u00a0that patients who are nondepressed and received Botox above the eyes frown less, and generally feel better than those who do not receive Botox injections. Another study done by M.Axel Wollmer from the University of Basel found that Botox was superior to a placebo in a group of depressed patients.<\/p>\n<p>These studies stem from the idea that facial expressions may feed information into our brains and thus influence our feelings, challenging the long-held belief that the brain sent information to our bodies that determined our emotions. This goes back to a theory of emotion that was proposed by Charles Darwin. Darwin believed that the control of expressions causes a similar effect on subjective emotions, where the brain examines facial expressions and then creates the appropriate feeling; if you\u2019re smiling your brain sends a signal that you\u2019re happy, and when you\u2019re frowning your brain sends a signal that you\u2019re sad.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, if you can\u2019t frown, it can actually help you feel better.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, visit this article from the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/03\/23\/opinion\/sunday\/dont-worry-get-botox.html?_r=1\">\u00a0New York Times, by\u00a0Richard A.
